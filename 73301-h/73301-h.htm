<small>THE FOUR LITTLE WINSLOWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THEY all lived in the big front room on the
top floor of Grandpa Winslow’s old-fashioned
house near Washington Square.
They had lived there for so long that Molly and
Maud—who were only nine and seven—could not
remember ever having lived anywhere else. But
Dulcie—who was nearly twelve—and Daisy—who
was ten and a half—had dim memories of a very
different home—a home that was always bright and
happy, and in which the grim figures of Grandma
Winslow and her daughter, Aunt Kate, played no
part.</p>

<p>It was more than five years since their father
had brought his four little motherless girls from the
Western town where they were born, to the stately,
gloomy old house near Washington Square. It had
seemed to Mr. Winslow the wisest thing to do, for
he was young and inexperienced, and the death of
his pretty young wife had almost broken his heart.
With the exception of his father, who was very old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
and infirm, and his stepmother, whom he had never
loved very much, he had no near relatives, and so
when his father had written in his trembling old
hand, offering a home to him and his four little girls,
he had accepted the offer, and they had left the
Western home, where they had been so happy, and
taken the long journey to New York, accompanied
by Lizzie, the faithful servant, who had formerly
been maid-of-all-work, but now acted as the children’s
nurse.</p>

<p>That was five years ago, and many things had
happened since then. In the first place, their father
had been in China for more than a year. Young
Jim Winslow, as every one called him, had not found
it easy to make a living in New York, and he had
ended by accepting the offer of a friend in China,
who promised him a good position in his business.
And one sad day, he had kissed his little girls good-bye
and gone away. How they had all cried, for
though Papa tried to be very cheerful, they felt quite
sure that this going away was different from any
other.</p>

<p>“When Papa went to The Centennial in Philadelphia,
he only stayed away a week,” Daisy had reminded
them, with a great effort to be cheerful,
“and he brought us all home something. I suppose
China is a great deal farther away than Philadelphia.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” said Dulcie, with difficulty suppressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
a sob; “it’s away the other side of the
world. But he says we must all be good till he
comes back, so we’ll have to try very hard.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got Lizzie, anyhow,” chimed in Molly.
“She won’t ever go away; she promised Papa she
wouldn’t leave us till he came back.”</p>

<p>That was a comforting thought, and as Lizzie had
come into the nursery at that moment, they had all
run to her, and she soon had Molly and Maud in her
lap, while Dulcie and Daisy sat on the arms of her
chair, for next to their father, they all loved Lizzie
better than any one in the world.</p>

<p>But alas! When Lizzie had promised not to
leave the children, she had not counted on her
temper. She loved the little girls dearly, but she
had never learned to control her quick temper, and
in less than a month from the day of Mr. Winslow’s
departure, she had been dismissed by Grandma for
having used what that lady called “outrageously
impertinent language.” That was a dreadful day
for the children, even more dreadful than the one
on which their father left for China. Their father
had occasionally left them for a short time before,
but never, never since their mother’s death, had
Lizzie been absent for a single night.</p>

<p>“Who’ll put us to bed?” wailed Maud, “and
give us our baths, and hear us say our prayers?
Oh! oh! I want to go away with Lizzie. I don’t
want to stay here any more—I don’t, I don’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Hush, Maudie, don’t cry so,” soothed Dulcie,
who was crying herself. “I’ll hear your prayers.
I’m ’most twelve, so I guess it will be all right, and
Daisy and I can take our own baths, so I guess we
can teach you and Molly to do it, too. But, oh,
Lizzie, Lizzie, I do want you so much!” And poor
Dulcie broke down utterly, and sobbed as if her
heart would break.</p>

<p>The next important event was Grandpa’s death.
This, though sad, was not the heart-break to the
children that Lizzie’s departure had been. Grandpa
was very feeble, and for several years had taken
small notice of them, except to nod and smile kindly
at them, when they came into his room, and ask
them their names, which he never seemed able to
remember from one day to another. Lizzie had
once told them that Grandpa was losing his mind,
and that they must always be very kind and polite
to him, and they had looked upon the old gentleman
with a kind of awe, which had been greatly increased
when, one morning, Mary, the chambermaid,
had come into the nursery to tell them in a
whisper that “their dear grandpa” had died suddenly
during the night.</p>

<p>But all these things had happened nearly a year
before the rainy January afternoon on which this
story begins. It had been a very stormy day, and
as Miss Hammond, the prim daily governess, who
came for three hours every morning, was laid up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
with a bad cold, there had not even been lessons to
break the monotony, and time had hung rather
heavily on the children’s hands. Even the usual
diversion of luncheon with their elders had been
denied them, for Aunt Kate had given a luncheon
party, and, according to the Winslow code, little
girls were expected to keep out of the way on all
such occasions. So Mary had brought them each
a bowl of bread and milk, that being less trouble
than anything else, and although bread and milk is
nourishing, it is not what Dulcie called “exciting,”
and by four o’clock they were all feeling decidedly
bored, and more than a little hungry.</p>

<p>Dulcie had read till her eyes ached; Daisy had
completed a whole spring outfit for Maud’s doll, and
Molly and Maud had played so many games of
lotto that Molly declared crossly she was sure she
could play lotto in her sleep.</p>

<p>“If only it didn’t pour so, I’d go round to the
library for another book,” remarked Dulcie, with a
yawn.</p>

<p>Dulcie cared more about reading than about almost
anything else in the world. She read everything
she could lay her hands on, and when her
father went away to China, he had given her a
ticket to the circulating library, which was only three
blocks away.</p>

<p>“I wish things happened to real people the way
they do to people in books,” said Molly. “If we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
were in a book, something interesting would be sure
to happen to us this afternoon. We’ve been in the
house all day, and only had bread and milk for
lunch.”</p>

<p>“Something rather interesting is going to happen
now,” said Daisy, who had been looking out of the
window for the past five minutes. “The Van Arsdales
across the street are going to have a party.
There’s an awning, and the ice-cream wagon has
just stopped there. We can watch the carriages
come, and if they happen to leave one of the parlor
shades up, the way they did that other time, we can
see them dance.”</p>

<p>Mollie and Maud looked interested, but Dulcie
sighed.</p>

<p>“I don’t see much fun in watching a party you
can’t go to yourself,” she said, discontentedly. “If
Grandma would only let us know some of the neighbors,
we might be invited to places sometimes. I
wonder how it would feel to have a party.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should like it much,” said Daisy.
“Things might go wrong, and that would be so embarrassing.
You remember the time those Leroy
children came to see us, and Grandma called out we
were making too much noise. I think I’d rather go
to other people’s parties, especially while we have to
live with Grandma and Aunt Kate.”</p>

<p>Dulcie sighed again.</p>

<p>“If only Papa would come home,” she said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
“Things weren’t half so bad when he was
here.”</p>

<p>“He is coming home next year,” put in Daisy,
cheerfully. Daisy always looked on the bright side
of things. “You know what he said in his last
letter, about our all having a nice little home together.
Perhaps Lizzie will come back then, too.
Wouldn’t that be lovely?”</p>

<p>“Mary told the butcher-man that Lizzie is going
to be married,” announced Maud. “I heard her
yesterday when I was in the kitchen, playing with
the kitty.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” declared Molly, indignantly.
“Lizzie never told Mary things; she said she was
an old gossip.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mary said it, anyhow,” persisted Maud.
“She told the butcher-man, and he said——”</p>

<p>“Oh, children, don’t argue,” interrupted peace-loving
Daisy. “Come here and watch for the party.
I guess the carriages will begin to come pretty
soon.”</p>

<p>“They had ice-cream for lunch down-stairs,” exclaimed
Molly, with a sudden recollection. “I wonder
if there’s any left!”</p>

<p>“If there were we wouldn’t get any,” said Dulcie.
“Mary and Bridget would be sure to eat it all up.”</p>

<p>“If Grandma were like a grandmother in a book,
she’d see that we had ice-cream, and lots of other
nice things,” remarked Molly, reflectively. “Book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
grandmothers are always so nice. I wonder why
real ones aren’t?”</p>

<p>“I guess real ones are, too,” said Daisy. “That’s
just the trouble with us. Grandma isn’t our real
grandmother; she’s only a step, and steps are never
any good. Even Aunt Kate isn’t our real aunt, because
Grandpa was only her stepfather.”</p>

<p>“Steps are pretty bad,” remarked Dulcie, “but
the worst of all is a stepmother, and, thank goodness,
we haven’t got that. If I thought we were ever
going to have a stepmother, I’d—I’d do something
awful.”</p>

<p>“What would you do?” inquired Molly, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I haven’t made up my mind yet,
but I’ve often thought about it. I’m sure it won’t
happen, though; Papa is much too kind to do anything
so dreadful, but if it did, well—don’t let’s talk
about it.” Dulcie’s dark little face had grown suddenly
very stern and determined, and her sisters regarded
her with something like awe. Although
only a little more than a year older than Daisy,
Dulcie had always been looked up to by the younger
children as a superior being. In the first place, she
was the only one of them who could remember
Mamma, and then she was so very clever. Dulcie
always knew her lessons, and moreover, she really
liked to study. Even Miss Hammond, strictest of
teachers, never had any complaints to make against
Dulcie; and Daisy had once overheard Aunt Kate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
telling a visitor that “the eldest child was really
remarkably bright, and took after her dear grandfather.”
Now, the children all knew that Grandpa
Winslow had been a great man in his day, and to
hear that one of them was supposed to resemble him
was a most wonderful compliment, especially from
Aunt Kate, who seldom said pleasant things about
any one. So perhaps Dulcie may be pardoned for
being a trifle conceited, and conscious of her own
importance.</p>

<p>“Here comes the first carriage,” announced
Daisy, from her post at the window.</p>

<p>All the others hurried to get a glimpse of the first
arrivals at the party. The carriage door was opened
by a man in livery, and several figures were hustled
up the Van Arsdales’ front steps, under the awning.
Another and another carriage followed, and the
next ten minutes were—according to Daisy—“really
quite exciting.” But watching the arrival
of guests at a party to which one has not been invited,
is not, after all, a very thrilling amusement,
and by the time the sixth carriage had deposited its
freight, and rolled away, even Daisy’s enthusiasm
had begun to cool.</p>

<p>“How hard it rains,” said Molly, flattening her
nose against the window-pane. “I wonder if the
stolen child is out in all this storm.”</p>

<p>“Of course she is,” said Dulcie in a tone of conviction.
“She’s been out all day with her basket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and she’s wet through and so cold and hungry.
But her basket isn’t full yet, and she doesn’t dare
go home, for fear that dreadful woman will beat
her.”</p>

<p>Dulcie gave a little shiver, and glanced from the
window back to the warm, comfortable room.</p>

<p>“It’s terribly sad,” said Daisy, with a sigh. “I
do wish we could help her find her family. If we
could only get acquainted with her, we might be
able to find out how she was stolen. They always
remember something, you know, even if it’s happened
when they were very little.”</p>

<p>“Let’s make up some more about her,” said
Molly. “Come and sit close to the register, it’s so
nice and warm. It’s nicer to talk about things like
that when you’re very comfortable.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Dulcie, and they all four
gathered round the register, where the hot air from
the furnace puffed in their faces.</p>

<p>“You begin, Dulcie,” commanded Daisy. “You
make up so much better than we do. Tell what’s
going to happen when she gets home to-night.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began Dulcie, her eyes growing big and
dreamy, as they always did when she “made up
things.” “It will be quite dark before she dares to
go home, and she will be so tired that she can hardly
drag herself up the long flight of stairs, to that dirty
garret. There won’t be any fire because the wicked
old woman will be drunk again. She’ll be asleep on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
a pile of rags, snoring very loud, and the stolen child
will be afraid to wake her. So she’ll put down her
basket, and creep away into a corner, and sit there
shivering, and trying to keep her teeth from chattering.
But by and by she’ll remember the little prayer
her mother taught her, and after that she won’t be
quite so unhappy, and—— Why, Maud, what is
the matter—whatever are you crying about?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t like it,” sobbed Maud, the tender-hearted,
flinging herself upon Dulcie’s lap. “I
don’t want the poor little girl to be so cold and hungry.”
And the sobs changed to a wail.</p>

<p>“Oh, hush, lovey, don’t cry like that,” pleaded
Daisy, soothing and petting her little sister, while
Dulcie added in hasty explanation:</p>

<p>“Don’t be such a baby, Maud. It’s only a story
I’m making up. We don’t really know anything
about the little girl at all.”</p>

<p>“But you said—you said she was so cold and so
hungry,” wailed Maud, “and I don’t like to hear
about people being cold and hungry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Maud, do stop,” protested Molly. “If you
cry so loud, Grandma will hear, and think how she’ll
scold.”</p>

<p>But Maud’s feelings were not so easily soothed,
and she continued to sob, and to declare over and
over again that she didn’t like sad stories—she didn’t
want to hear about the stolen child—until the other
three were at their wits’ end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Maud,” exclaimed
Daisy, with a sudden inspiration. “If you’ll stop
crying, I’ll go down to the kitchen and see if
there isn’t some ice-cream left. If there is,
I’ll coax Bridget to let me have some, and
you shall eat every bit of it, because you’re the
youngest.”</p>

<p>Maud stopped short in the middle of a wail.</p>

<p>“Will you really?” she inquired doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” promised Daisy. “Now wipe your
eyes, like a good girl. Where’s your handkerchief?
Oh, you haven’t got one. Well, never mind, here’s
mine. There, that’s all right. You won’t cry any
more, will you?”</p>

<p>“Suppose there isn’t any ice-cream left?” suggested
Maud, still doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s sure to be some cake left, anyhow,
and I’m sure Bridget will give me a piece for
you. Now keep still, and I’ll be back just as quick
as I can.”</p>

<p>Maud was mollified and Daisy ran quickly down
the four flights of stairs to the basement without
meeting any one by the way. She tiptoed past
Grandma’s door, which was fortunately closed, or
she would probably have been stopped and questioned.
Arrived at the kitchen, she found Bridget
and Mary both taking afternoon tea. They were
sitting at the kitchen table, and between them was a
dish containing several tempting little frosted cakes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
At Daisy’s entrance they both looked up, and Mary
inquired rather sharply:</p>

<p>“Now what in the world are you after down here
at this time of day? Did your grandma send you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Daisy, pausing in the doorway, “nobody
sent me. I just came to ask if there was any
ice-cream left. I don’t want much, only a little
for Maud. Dulcie told a story that made her cry,
and I promised to bring her something to eat if I
could. She loves ice-cream, and I thought perhaps——”
Daisy paused in some embarrassment.</p>

<p>Both the maids laughed, and Bridget—who was
generally good-natured—pushed back her chair from
the table.</p>

<p>“There isn’t very much left,” she said. “I was
keeping it for our supper, but I suppose you may as
well have it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” cried Daisy, gratefully;
“you’re very kind. I’m sorry to take it away from
you and Mary, but Maud is so unhappy. I’m
sure the ice-cream will make her feel cheerful
again.”</p>

<p>Bridget retired to the ice-box, from whence she
presently returned with a well-filled saucer of pink
ice-cream.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad there isn’t enough for you all,” she
said, kindly, “but the madame’s that stingy, she
never will order more than just enough to go round.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
You can have a couple of these cakes, anyhow, and
that’ll be better than nothing.”</p>

<p>Daisy’s heart beat very fast, as she stole softly
up-stairs again with her precious burden. She
reached the second floor in safety, and was just beginning
to breathe more freely, when there came an
interruption. Grandma’s door opened suddenly,
and a sharp, querulous voice demanded:</p>

<p>“Who’s that?”</p>

<p>Daisy’s heart gave a big jump, but she tried to
speak quite naturally.</p>

<p>“It’s only I, Grandma,” she faltered, and try as
she might, she could not keep the tremor altogether
out of her voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winslow stepped out into the hall.</p>

<p>“What is that you are carrying so carefully?”
she inquired, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s just a little ice-cream, and some cakes
that were left from the lunch party. Bridget gave
them to me for Maud. Maud was crying over a
story Dulcie told, and——”</p>

<p>“Never mind about explanations,” interrupted
Grandma, frowning. “You all know perfectly well
that you are not allowed to eat between meals, or to
bring food up-stairs. Take those things directly
back to the kitchen. I shall speak to Bridget about
this to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>The tears started to Daisy’s blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Grandma,” she pleaded, “please do let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
have it, just this once. Maud loves ice-cream so
much, and she hardly ever has any. You see, it was
this way: Maud made up a story about a little beggar
girl we see sometimes. We think she must be a
stolen child, because she has blue eyes and golden
hair; stolen children always have in books, and we
like to make up things about her. This was a very
sad story, but we didn’t think Maud——”</p>

<p>“I am not interested in all that nonsense,” interrupted
Grandma, impatiently. “Do as I tell
you, and never let me hear of your bringing food
up-stairs again without permission.”</p>

<p>Daisy’s lip quivered, but she dared not disobey,
and with a sigh that was half a sob, she turned away,
and went slowly down-stairs again. When she returned
to the nursery, five minutes later, she was
relieved to find that Maud had stopped crying, and
was standing with Molly, eagerly looking out of the
window.</p>

<p>“They’re beginning to dance,” announced Maud.
“The gas is lit in the parlor, and they haven’t pulled
down one shade.”</p>

<p>“I suppose there wasn’t any cream left,” said
Dulcie in a low voice. In their interest in the Van
Arsdales’ party, the two younger ones had apparently
forgotten the subject of food.</p>

<p>“There was a little,” Daisy admitted, “and
Bridget let me have it for Maud, and some cakes,
too; but on the way up-stairs I met Grandma, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
she made me take the things back to the kitchen.
She said we were forbidden to bring food up here,
or to eat between meals.”</p>

<p>Dulcie’s eyes flashed. For a moment she did not
speak, and then she said, slowly:</p>

<p>“I hate Grandma, and some day I’m going to tell
her so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dulcie,” gasped Daisy, in horrified reproach,
“you mustn’t say such things. It’s terribly
wicked to hate people.”</p>

<p>“I know it is,” said Dulcie, “and I suppose I
must be a very wicked person. Perhaps I shall
never go to heaven, but I do hate Grandma just the
same, and there isn’t any use in pretending I don’t.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>A VISITOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PEOPLE dined earlier in 1880 than they do
nowadays. The Winslows’ dinner hour was
six o’clock, and by seven the table had been
cleared, and the family settled down in the dining-room,
where they usually spent their evenings. The
children’s bedtime was eight, and that hour after
dinner always seemed to them the longest hour of
the whole day. Mrs. Winslow had a theory that
families should spend their evenings together, and so
they were never allowed to wander off and find
amusements for themselves. She also had another
theory, that young people should never speak except
when addressed by their elders, and as neither she
nor her daughter were at all fond of the society of
children, the little girls were seldom encouraged to
join in the conversation. Dulcie had once remarked
that Grandma only talked when she had something
to scold about, and Aunt Kate spent a great deal of
time knitting caps for sailors, and was so busy counting
stitches that she was apt to forget the presence
of any one else in the room. Aunt Kate was considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
among her friends to be a very charitable
woman. She was on the Board of any number of
societies for improving the condition of the poor,
and was constantly attending “Meetings,” but it
was seldom that she troubled herself to think of the
four little girls who lived in the big front room on
the top floor, and who, if not objects of charity,
would certainly have been better and happier for a
little mothering now and then.</p>

<p>Grandma was very fond of playing solitaire, and
as soon as the dinner-table was cleared, she generally
got out the cards, and that meant that she was not
to be disturbed by any one, even her daughter.
Dulcie could often find amusement in a book, or
even in the evening paper, but to the three younger
ones that hour between dinner and bedtime was decidedly
tiresome.</p>

<p>On this particular January evening things seemed,
if possible, even duller than usual. The children
had been in the house all day, and were, in consequence,
feeling particularly wide awake, and anxious
for some kind of active exercise. When Aunt Kate
requested Molly to wind some wool for her, the little
girl jumped up with such alacrity that she knocked
over a chair, and received a severe reproof from
Grandma.</p>

<p>“Careless child,” scolded the old lady, looking
up from her cards with a frown; “can’t you move
without breaking the furniture?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Molly, who was rather sensitive, blushed scarlet,
and murmured an apology. But even winding wool
is more interesting than doing nothing at all, so she
soon cheered up, and ventured a timid attempt at
conversation.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a pretty cap,” she remarked
politely. “If I were a sailor I think I should
like it.”</p>

<p>“Should you?” said Miss Kate, sarcastically.
“It is rather a pity you are not a sailor, then,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Aunt Kate had a way of saying things in that
sarcastic tone, and Molly instantly relapsed into embarrassed
silence. Dulcie was glancing over the
front page of the <i>Evening Post</i>, being very careful
not to rattle the paper, because the rattling of a
newspaper made Grandma nervous. Maud stifled
a yawn, and began surreptitiously rubbing her eyes.
Maud, being the youngest, was sometimes permitted
to go to bed before her sisters, but to-night Grandma
was absorbed in her solitaire, and did not notice the
yawn. Daisy kept her eyes fixed on the clock.
Twenty minutes to eight. Only twenty more minutes,
and then they would all be free. They would
hurry and get undressed, and when they were in
bed perhaps Dulcie would tell them stories about
Mamma. She often did after they had said their
prayers, and the light was out, and it was all very
cozy and pleasant. Mamma had talked to Dulcie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
just before she died, and told her she must be a
little mother to the others, and always be good to
them and never let them forget their prayers.
Molly had once said that perhaps Mamma was looking
down on them from heaven, and that when they
were in bed, and Dulcie was talking about her, she
came to them, and loved them, although, of course,
they could not see her. Daisy and Maud had
thought this a beautiful idea, and had been much
surprised to hear Dulcie sigh, and say rather sadly:</p>

<p>“I hope she doesn’t know about things.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” Molly had demanded in astonishment.
“I should think you would love to think that
perhaps Mamma came to see us.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to have her unhappy about us,”
Dulcie answered, gravely, “and I’m afraid she
would be unhappy if she knew about Grandma.
You can’t remember Danby, and how happy we were
there, but I can, and I know how different everything
was when Mamma was here.”</p>

<p>Daisy wished that she could remember that happy
time, too, but the memories were all very dim and indistinct.</p>

<p>For five minutes the only sounds to break the stillness
of the room were the ticking of the clock and
the click of Aunt Kate’s knitting needles. Then the
newspaper rustled, and Grandma looked up from
her cards for the second time.</p>

<p>“Leave that paper alone, Dulcie,” she said, impatiently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
“You know the rustling of a newspaper
is very unpleasant to me.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Grandma,” apologized Dulcie.
“I’ll try not to do it again. I was so interested in
something I was reading, I turned over the sheet
to finish it.”</p>

<p>“What were you reading?” Grandma inquired
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“About a man who was killed. They think he
was murdered. They found his body——”</p>

<p>“Good gracious, child!” cried Grandma, quite
forgetting to shuffle her cards in her dismay.
“Don’t you know you are not to read such things?
Put that paper down at once, and don’t let me see
you touch a newspaper again until you are old
enough to know what to read, and what to leave
alone.”</p>

<p>Dulcie blushed.</p>

<p>“Miss Hammond says everybody ought to read
the newspaper,” she began. “It’s very interesting
about that man. Won’t you please let me finish it,
Grandma?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, and don’t argue. Such things
are not proper reading for a child of your age.
Your father would be very angry if he ever heard
of your reading such disgusting stories.”</p>

<p>“Would he?” said Dulcie, and she instantly put
down the paper. There was no one in the world
whom Dulcie loved as she loved her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Of course he would,” said Mrs. Winslow.
“Remember, you are not to look at a newspaper
again until I give you permission. What are you
rubbing your eyes in that way for, Maud?”</p>

<p>“I’m sleepy,” said Maud. Maud was less afraid
of Grandma than any of the others, and if Mrs.
Winslow had a favorite among her stepson’s children,
it was little curly-headed Maud, who was
scarcely more than a baby when the family had arrived
from the West five years ago.</p>

<p>Grandma glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>“Nearly five minutes to eight,” she said; “you
may as well all go to bed.”</p>

<p>Four little girls sprang from their chairs with so
much alacrity that, if Grandma had been a real
grandmother, instead of “only a step,” as Dulcie
called her, her feelings might have been hurt. But
Mrs. Winslow had no objection to the children’s
evident dislike of her society. She meant to do her
duty to her husband’s grandchildren, but she never
thought of them in any other light than as a troublesome
incumbrance. They each gave her a sedate
“duty kiss,” and murmured a polite “Good-night,
Grandma,” and she heaved a sigh of relief that another
day was over. As for Aunt Kate, she frankly
confessed that she hated to be kissed, and the children
never dreamed of troubling her in any such
way.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is nice to get up here again, all by ourselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
isn’t it?” cried Daisy, with a happy little
skip, as they entered their own big nursery, and
Dulcie lighted the gas. “I feel sometimes as if I
couldn’t breathe down there with Grandma and
Aunt Kate. Let’s hurry to bed, and then you’ll
talk to us about Mamma, won’t you, Dulcie?”</p>

<p>Dulcie nodded rather absently. She was still
thinking about the newspaper story that Grandma
had interrupted.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Maud, eagerly. “There’s
the singing lady.”</p>

<p>They all paused to listen, and, sure enough, from
somewhere that sounded as if it came from within
the wall, could be distinctly heard the notes of a
piano, and of a sweet voice singing. The walls in
the old house were rather thin, and by pressing their
ears against the party wall, which divided the Winslows’
from the house next door, they could even
distinguish the words of the song.</p>

<p>“It’s ‘Robin Adair,’” said Molly. “Isn’t it
pretty? I think I like it best of all the songs she
sings.”</p>

<p>“I like ‘Darby and Joan’ best,” affirmed Daisy;
“it always makes me think of such nice, comfortable
things. I do wish we knew her. I’m sure she must
be nice; she’s got such a lovely voice.”</p>

<p>“Grandma would never let us go to see her,” said
Dulcie, with conviction. “She says it isn’t proper
to call on people she doesn’t know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Perhaps it’s more interesting not to know her,”
said cheerful Daisy. “It’s so exciting to make up
stories about her. She must be rather poor to live
away up on the top floor of that boarding-house. I
wish we could see her in the street sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we do see her,” said Dulcie; “we haven’t
any idea what she looks like. Now, hurry and get
undressed, children. It’s pretty cold up here; I
think the furnace must be very low.”</p>

<p>Daisy and Molly began unfastening their dresses,
but Maud still remained with her ear glued to the
wall.</p>

<p>“Come, Maud, don’t dawdle,” commanded
Dulcie, a little impatiently. “I’ll help you undress.”</p>

<p>“I want to listen to the singing lady,” objected
Maud. “I love music.”</p>

<p>“You can listen in bed just as well, and if you
stay up in this cold room, you may get another sore
throat, and you wouldn’t like that, you know. My
goodness! there’s the door-bell. Who can it be at
this time of night?”</p>

<p>Evening visitors were not frequent at the Winslows’,
and Molly was dispatched to peep over the
banister.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s that minister who comes to see
Aunt Kate,” said Dulcie, and this opinion was rather
strengthened when Molly reported having heard a
gentleman’s voice speaking to Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>Aunt Kate’s visitors were not interesting to the
children, and they had almost forgotten the incident
of the door-bell, when there came an unexpected tap
at the nursery door.</p>

<p>“Children,” called Mary’s voice, rather breathless
from the three long flights of stairs, “your
grandma says you’re to come down right away.
Your uncle’s here.”</p>

<p>There was a simultaneous exclamation of astonishment
from four very excited little girls.</p>

<p>“Our uncle! What uncle? Oh, Mary, do tell
us quick.” And the door was flung open, revealing
four children in various stages of undressing.</p>

<p>“His name is Maitland,” said Mary, “and he’s
a youngish gentleman. I never saw him before.”</p>

<p>“It must be Uncle Stephen; Mamma’s brother
from California,” said Dulcie. “I think he’s the
only uncle we’ve got. Oh, isn’t it exciting? Hurry,
children, do please hurry!”</p>

<p>“I can’t go down with my boots unbuttoned,”
complained Daisy. “O dear! where’s the shoe
buttoner? Fasten your dress, Molly, and take those
curlers off Maud’s hair.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” said Mary, good-naturedly. “I’m
glad you’ve got an uncle to look after you. You’d
better tell him a few things before he goes away
again.”</p>

<p>“What sort of things?” inquired Daisy, innocently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Mary laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you know as well as I do,” she
said, evasively. “If you don’t, so much the better.”</p>

<p>“Did our uncle ask for Grandma?” Dulcie
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and she’s in the parlor with him now.
So’s Miss Kate.”</p>

<p>Dulcie’s face fell.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much use in our going down, then,”
she said, with a sigh. “Grandma won’t let us talk.
She never does when there’s company.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she will this time, because it’s our
uncle,” said Daisy, who was always hoping pleasant
things were going to happen. “Anyhow, it will be
lovely to see somebody belonging to Mamma. I remember
Papa told us about Uncle Stephen. He’s
lived in California ever since he was twenty, and
none of us has ever seen him. There! my boots
are done. Now I can help Maud, if you’ll button
Molly’s dress, Mary.”</p>

<p>Four little hearts were beating rather quickly, as
the children hurried down-stairs to the parlor, from
whence the sound of voices could be heard.</p>

<p>“Grandma’s talking in her ‘company voice,’”
whispered Dulcie. “She must like Uncle Stephen
or she wouldn’t sound so polite.”</p>

<p>Grandma and Aunt Kate were both smiling when
the children entered the parlor, and their companion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
a tall, broad-shouldered young man, rose from the
sofa, and came forward to meet them.</p>

<p>“So these are Ethel’s little girls,” he said, and
Grandma answered, still in her “company voice”:</p>

<p>“Yes, here they are, all four. Children, this is
your Uncle Stephen from California.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Dulcie, holding out her hand,
with her most grown-up air; “Papa told us all about
you. I think you were very kind to take the trouble
to come to see us. I’m Dulcie, the eldest, and this is
Daisy. Her real name is Margaret, after Grandma
Maitland, but everybody calls her Daisy. These
others are Molly and Maud. Molly’s named for
Mamma’s sister, who died, and Maud is just a name
Mamma liked in a book.”</p>

<p>Dulcie paused, rather breathless from her long
speech. The three younger children gazed at her
in undisguised admiration. Under no combination
of circumstances could any one of them have dared
to make such a wonderful speech, and in Grandma’s
presence, too. The visitor smiled, and they all
thought he had a very pleasant smile indeed.</p>

<p>“Of course I wanted to come to see you,” he said
in a voice that was as pleasant as his smile. And,
instead of taking Dulcie’s outstretched hand, he bent
and kissed her.</p>

<p>That broke the ice, for of course, all the others
had to be kissed, too, and in a very few minutes
Maud was perched on Uncle Stephen’s knee, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
other three were sitting beside him on the sofa. If
Grandma and Aunt Kate were displeased with this
state of affairs, they did not show it. Grandma
continued to talk in her “company voice,” and Aunt
Kate smiled as her needles flew.</p>

<p>Mr. Maitland explained that he had come east
on a business trip, and was only spending a few
days in New York.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I am starting back to California to-morrow
night,” he said, “but I couldn’t leave without
having a glimpse of Ethel’s children. Jim
stopped to see me in San Francisco, on his way to
Hong Kong, and I asked for your address, thinking
I might be in this part of the world sometime.”</p>

<p>“Papa’s coming home next year,” ventured
Maud, who suddenly felt very safe in Grandma’s
presence, for was not Uncle Stephen’s kind arm
around her, and had he not said that she had eyes
like Mamma’s? “When he comes home we’re going
to have a little house of our own, and perhaps
Lizzie——”</p>

<p>Maud paused, admonished by a warning nudge
from Dulcie. Grandma had forbidden the mention
of Lizzie’s name.</p>

<p>“We had a letter from Papa last week,” put in
Dulcie, quickly, hoping that Grandma had not
noticed Maud’s slip. “He tells us such funny
things about China. Does he ever write to you,
Uncle Stephen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Yes, occasionally. I heard from him about a
month ago.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you about the Chinese people eating
rats and mice?” inquired Molly. “We used to
worry for fear Papa might have to eat them, but
he says he doesn’t.”</p>

<p>Uncle Stephen laughed, and even Grandma and
Aunt Kate looked amused, but just then Grandma
gave the little warning cough, which always meant
“children should be seen and not heard,” and Molly
instantly relapsed into embarrassed silence.</p>

<p>Altogether, the call was a trifle disappointing.
Aunt Kate talked about missions, but Uncle Stephen
didn’t seem particularly interested in that subject,
and in about twenty minutes he took out his watch,
and remarked that he was afraid he must be going.</p>

<p>“I have an engagement with a business friend at
nine,” he said, “but I want to see these little nieces
of mine again before I leave New York. To-morrow
is Saturday, and I expect to finish all my business
by noon. My train doesn’t leave till half-past
six. May I have these young people to spend the
afternoon with me? I will promise to take good
care of them.”</p>

<p>That was a tremendous moment. Would
Grandma consent? That was the question that four
little eager girls were asking themselves. Daisy
ventured to give the old lady a pleading glance.
Dulcie and Molly clasped their hands nervously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
There was a moment of breathless suspense, and
then, to everybody’s surprise, Grandma answered
quite pleasantly:</p>

<p>“I am sure they would enjoy it very much, and
I see no objection, if you really want to be troubled
with them.”</p>

<p>“I want them very much,” said Uncle Stephen,
with his kind, pleasant smile. “I will call for them
at about noon, and we will lunch at the Fifth Avenue,
where I am staying, and do something together
in the afternoon. Now I must be off, as I see it is
getting near the time for my appointment, so good-night,
chicks. Be sure to be ready for me at twelve
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I never believed she’d let us,” declared Daisy,
when they were talking things over in the nursery,
ten minutes later. “My heart just stood still; I
was so sure she was going to say no.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she didn’t dare,” suggested Molly.
“He’s our uncle, you know. Oh, aren’t uncles
lovely? I never had any idea they were so nice.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t know anything about them,” said
Daisy. “We don’t know much about any relations
except fathers. Now let’s hurry to bed, and get to
sleep as quick as we can, so it won’t seem so long
till to-morrow.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>A WONDERFUL DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“IT’S the most interesting thing that ever happened
to us,” declared Molly. “It’s almost
like a book thing.”</p>

<p>“It would be even more exciting if we had
thought Uncle Stephen was dead,” said Dulcie, in
a tone of some regret. “You remember how exciting
it was in ‘Kathie’s Three Wishes,’ when her
Uncle Robert came home rich, after everybody had
thought he was dead for years and years. I wonder
if Uncle Stephen is rich.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” said Daisy. “He
must have a good deal of money to be able to take
us all to the Fifth Avenue Hotel to lunch. I wonder
where he’ll take us afterwards. It might be to
the Aquarium. Do you remember the time Papa
took us there, Dulcie, and we saw those wonderful
fish, and snakes, and things?”</p>

<p>Maud’s face clouded.</p>

<p>“I don’t like snakes,” she protested; “I hope
Uncle Stephen won’t take us there. I dream about
snakes sometimes, and it’s horrid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“Don’t be a baby,” began Molly, rather sharply,
but Daisy interposed.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry, Maudie, till we know where
we really are going. Perhaps Uncle Stephen doesn’t
intend to take us anywhere except to the hotel. We
may just stay there all the afternoon, and watch the
people. That would be very interesting.”</p>

<p>Dulcie glanced at herself in the mirror. It was
only half-past eleven, but they were already dressed,
because, as Daisy wisely remarked, “Uncle Stephen
might happen to come ahead of time, and it wouldn’t
be polite to keep a gentleman waiting.”</p>

<p>“I wish I hadn’t let my best hat get rained on
that day,” remarked Dulcie, with a sigh. “It’s so
spotted, I don’t think it’s at all the right thing to
wear to a hotel. If Papa were here, I know he
would have bought me a new one, but Grandma
doesn’t care how shabby our things are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t so very spotty, and perhaps nobody
will notice,” said Daisy, hopefully. “Don’t let’s
think about anything that isn’t pleasant to-day.
Isn’t it fortunate the sun has come out? If it had
kept on raining, Grandma would have made us all
wear our old clothes, and that would have been a
great deal worse than just a few spots on one hat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it isn’t your hat,” objected Dulcie.
“Yours looks almost as good as new, and Molly’s
and Maud’s are all right, too.”</p>

<p>For a moment Daisy hesitated, and then, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
sudden determination, she took off her own hat, and
held it out to Dulcie.</p>

<p>“Let’s change,” she proposed cheerfully. “You’re
the eldest, and ought to look the best, and I really
don’t mind a bit.”</p>

<p>Dulcie drew back, blushing.</p>

<p>“As if I would do anything so mean,” she declared,
indignantly. “I believe you’re one of the
most unselfish people in the world, Daisy. It was
all my own fault, anyhow. If I had taken an umbrella
that day, as Grandma told me to, I wouldn’t
have spoiled my hat. Now, suppose we go down
and wait for Uncle Stephen on the sidewalk. It’s
rather hot up here, with all our things on.”</p>

<p>This suggestion was greeted with favor, and a
few minutes later the front door had closed behind
four very happy little girls. Grandma and Aunt
Kate were both out, so there was no one but Mary to
see them start, but Mary happened to be in a good
humor that morning, and greatly comforted Dulcie
by the assurance that nobody would notice the spots
on her hat, and that they all looked “just as nice as
could be.”</p>

<p>“We’ll walk up and down,” said Dulcie; “it’s too
cold to stand still, but we mustn’t go far, or we
might miss Uncle Stephen. Oh, it is grand to be
going somewhere, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose there’ll be ice-cream for lunch?”
inquired Maud, anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Of course there will be,” said Molly. “You
can have anything you want at a hotel. You just
pay a dollar, and they’ll bring you whatever you
ask for. I know, because Papa took me to the
Clarendon once, the time you all had the measles,
and mine hadn’t come out yet.”</p>

<p>“Can you even ask for two helpings?” questioned
Maud, with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so, but perhaps it wouldn’t be
polite to take more than one. Uncle Stephen might
think it was piggish.”</p>

<p>“Of course he would,” said Dulcie, who had
grown suddenly grave; “it wouldn’t do at all. And
that makes me think of something I want to say to
you all. Give me your hand, Maud, so we can all
walk together. It’s about our loyalty to Grandma.
You know what Papa used to tell us about always
being loyal to our family, and never telling things
that happen at home. We mustn’t let Uncle Stephen
think we don’t have ice-cream, and nice things like
that every day. We mustn’t mention Grandma’s
being cross, or—or any disagreeable things at all.
Will you all remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” promised Daisy, readily, but Molly looked
a little doubtful.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why we should have to be so very
particular with Uncle Stephen,” she objected; “he’s
our real uncle, and Grandma’s only a step.”</p>

<p>“But we live with Grandma,” rebuked Dulcie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
“Papa said it was very disloyal to talk about people
we live with. Don’t look so solemn, Maudie. Of
course, if Uncle Stephen or the waiter should ask us
if we would like another helping of ice-cream, it
would be all right to say yes.”</p>

<p>Maud’s face brightened.</p>

<p>“I sort of think Uncle Stephen will ask us,” she
said. “He seemed so very kind, and I’m sure he
likes me best, because he said I looked like Mamma.
Let’s cross over. If the singing lady should happen
to be at her window, she might like to see how nice
we look.”</p>

<p>The others laughed, but complied with the request.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anybody at the windows,” said
Molly, glancing up at the top floor of the boarding-house.
“What makes you so much interested in
that lady, Maud? She may not be a bit interesting.”</p>

<p>“I love to hear her sing,” said Maud, “and besides,
I’ve got a secret,” she added, but in so low a
tone that the others did not catch the words. At
that moment there was an excited exclamation from
Daisy, of “here he comes; he’s just turned the corner.”
And everything else was forgotten in the joy
of running to meet Uncle Stephen.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” laughed Mr. Maitland, kissing
them all round, “so here you are, all four. No
danger of being kept waiting, I see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we wouldn’t do that,” protested Dulcie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
quite shocked at the mere suggestion. “We got
ready early, in case you should happen to come before
twelve. Grandma and Aunt Kate have both
gone out, so there isn’t any use of your going in to
see them.”</p>

<p>“You are the people I want to see this time,”
said Uncle Stephen, with a rather peculiar smile.
“I came a little early on purpose, so as to have
plenty of time for lunch. I have tickets for ‘The
Pirates of Penzance’ this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“‘The Pirates of Penzance,’” repeated Dulcie,
with a little gasp. “Why—why, that’s at a theatre,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“To be sure it is, and a very charming little
operetta it is, too. I hope you haven’t all seen it
already.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Dulcie, “we never—that is, I
mean we don’t often go to theatres. Daisy and I
saw ‘Rip Van Winkle’ once with Papa. It’s very
wonderful—I mean it’s very kind of you to take us.”</p>

<p>And despite all Dulcie’s attempts to maintain
what she considered the proper demeanor of a
grown-up young lady, she could not refrain from
a little skip of delight.</p>

<p>As for the other three, they made no attempt
whatever to conceal their delight, and began plying
Uncle Stephen with a shower of questions about
“The Pirates of Penzance,” which lasted till they
reached the corner of Fifth Avenue, where he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
obliged to interrupt them, to ask whether they
would prefer walking to the hotel or taking a stage.</p>

<p>“Oh, a stage, please—that is, if you don’t mind,”
pleaded Molly. “We just love riding in the stages.
We hardly ever get a ride now, since Papa and
Lizzie went away, because Grandma won’t let us go
by ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Who is Lizzie?” Mr. Maitland asked, as they
paused on the corner, to await an approaching stage.</p>

<p>“She was our nurse,” Dulcie explained, “but she
went away last summer. We really don’t need a
nurse any more, we’re getting so big.”</p>

<p>Mr. Maitland glanced down at the four little
figures, as if he did not consider them “so very
big,” after all, but just then the stage came within
hailing distance, and he made no remarks on the
subject.</p>

<p>It was only a short distance to the hotel, but the
children thoroughly enjoyed the little ride, especially
Maud, who, somewhat to Dulcie’s disapproval, requested
to be permitted to pay the fares. Because,
as she explained, “it made one feel so grand to
spend money.” Uncle Stephen laughed so much,
and was so kind and genial, that even Dulcie forgot
to be dignified, and by the time they reached their
destination, they were all the best of friends.</p>

<p>“I am going to leave you in the reception-room
for a few moments,” Mr. Maitland said, leading the
way across the marble hall of the big hotel, “while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
I look up two ladies who are to lunch with us. They
are friends of mine from San Francisco, who have
met your father, and are anxious to see you all.”</p>

<p>Nobody said anything, but all were conscious of
a sensation of disappointment, which Molly was the
first to put into words, the moment they found themselves
alone in the reception-room.</p>

<p>“If there are going to be ladies,” she said, ruefully,
“Uncle Stephen will talk to them all the time,
and we won’t have half so much fun.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they are very nice ladies,” suggested
Daisy. “He said they knew Papa, and wanted to
know us. Anyhow, we’re going to a real theatre,
and nothing can spoil that.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid ladies notice other people’s clothes
more than gentlemen do,” said Dulcie, with a sigh,
and a glance in the long mirror. “Do you think
those spots show very much, Daisy?”</p>

<p>“No, not so very much,” answered Daisy, divided
between her desire to speak the truth, and fear of
making her sister still more uncomfortable. “Perhaps
the ladies won’t notice the spots at all, if the
light isn’t too bright.”</p>

<p>Dulcie sighed again, but was forced to make the
best of the situation, and in another moment Uncle
Stephen returned, accompanied by such a very
pretty young lady that, in their surprise and admiration,
the children quite forgot to worry about their
own shortcomings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“This is Miss Florence Leslie, children,” said Mr.
Maitland. “Her mother, Mrs. Leslie, will be down
in a few moments.”</p>

<p>“You see, I couldn’t wait for Mother,” the young
lady explained, smiling, and showing such fascinating
dimples, that Daisy and Molly both longed to
kiss her. “I was so anxious to see you all. Now
let me see if I can guess which is which, from your
father’s description. This tall one must be Dulcie,
I am sure, and the little curly-haired one is Maud.
These others are Daisy and Molly.”</p>

<p>“Why, you know all our names,” exclaimed
Molly, in astonishment. “Did you ever see us
before?”</p>

<p>“No, but I have heard a great deal about you
from your father. We saw a good deal of him in
San Francisco, before he sailed for Hong Kong, and
he and my brother are in business together now. I
wonder if you would each be willing to give me a
kiss.”</p>

<p>“Of course we would,” said Dulcie, heartily, and
four little faces were eagerly raised. Miss Leslie
kissed them all, “not just duty kisses,” Molly said
afterwards, but as if she really liked doing it, and
in less than five minutes they were chattering away
to this new acquaintance as if they had known her
all their lives.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Leslie appeared, and they all went into
the dining-room. Mrs. Leslie was not as pretty as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
her daughter, but she had a very sweet face, and was
so kind and motherly that the little girls soon felt
almost as much at home with her as with Miss
Florence.</p>

<p>“And now who is going to order the luncheon?”
Uncle Stephen asked, when they had taken their
places at one of the round tables in the big, crowded
dining-room. “Will you do it, Mrs. Leslie?”</p>

<p>“Suppose we let Dulcie order,” suggested Miss
Florence. “When I was a little girl, and we went
to a hotel, I remember half the fun was in ordering
things to eat.”</p>

<p>Dulcie gasped, as the waiter handed her the long
bill of fare.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t think I could,” she faltered; “there
are so many things, I shouldn’t know where to begin.
What’s the matter, Maud?”</p>

<p>“It’s about the ice-cream,” whispered Maud.
“It doesn’t matter what else we have.” Maud’s
whisper was sufficiently audible to be heard by the
whole party, and all the grown-ups laughed, somewhat
to the little girl’s embarrassment. Then Miss
Leslie said, kindly:</p>

<p>“I will help you, if you would like to have me,”
and on Dulcie’s grateful request, she gave the waiter
an order, which seemed to the children almost appallingly
large.</p>

<p>What a delicious meal it was, and how they all
enjoyed it! Even Dulcie forgot her intention of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
taking a light lunch, for fear Uncle Stephen might
think she was hungry, which would reflect unfavorably
on Grandma’s providing. Miss Leslie certainly
did not forget to order ice-cream, and, better still,
she took two helpings of it herself, and advised them
all to do likewise. Mr. Maitland and Mrs. Leslie
seemed to have a good deal to say to each other, but
Miss Florence devoted herself almost exclusively to
the children, and before luncheon was over, had
succeeded in winning all their hearts.</p>

<p>“I wish you were going to the theatre with us,”
Molly remarked, regretfully, as they were leaving
the dining-room, and she gave her new friend’s hand
an affectionate squeeze.</p>

<p>“I am going,” said Miss Leslie, smiling; “your
uncle invited me. He asked Mother, too, but she
declined on account of a headache.”</p>

<p>Molly gave vent to her satisfaction by a little
squeal of delight, and Maud—who was nothing if
not truthful—remarked in a sudden burst of confidence:</p>

<p>“We didn’t think we were going to like it when
Uncle Stephen said ladies were coming to lunch, but
you’re not a bit like an ordinary lady.”</p>

<p>“Maud!” cried Dulcie, reprovingly, but Miss
Leslie laughed merrily, and did not seem in the least
offended.</p>

<p>That was a wonderful, never-to-be-forgotten
afternoon. Long after their elders had ceased to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
think of it, the four little girls loved to recall its
delights. The bright little opera, with its charming
music, and amusing dialogue. The funny pirate
chief, who frightened Maud at first, and then fascinated
her for the rest of the afternoon. The pompous
major-general, with his numerous family of
daughters. And, last but not least, the gallant
policemen, who were as much afraid of the pirate
band as the pirates were afraid of them. It was all
one continuous delight. But even better than the
play was the pleasant companionship. Long before
the afternoon was over, they had all come to the
conclusion that, with the exception of Papa, and
possibly the faithful Lizzie, Uncle Stephen and
Miss Leslie were “the two nicest grown-ups” they
had ever met.</p>

<p>But everything, even “The Pirates of Penzance,”
must come to an end at last, and all too soon the
curtain had fallen on the last rollicking chorus, and
they were making their way out through the crowd,
into the dusk of the winter afternoon.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be lovely if nice things never came
to an end?” remarked Dulcie, as they stood on the
cold corner, while Uncle Stephen went in quest of a
cab.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie smiled.</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t be any next time to look forward
to, then,” she said.</p>

<p>“But we don’t have any next times,” began Molly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
and checked herself, warned by a reproving glance
from Dulcie.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie looked rather surprised, but before
she could ask any questions, Uncle Stephen returned,
and they were all packed into a cab, Mr. Maitland
explaining that he and Miss Florence were
in a hurry, and must get home as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“It’s been the loveliest afternoon we ever had in
our lives,” declared Daisy, as the cab drew up before
their own door. “Oh, Uncle Stephen, won’t
we see you again—have you really got to go back to
California to-night?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid so,” Uncle Stephen answered, with
a kind glance at the row of sober little faces, “but
perhaps I shall come back again before such a very
long time.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget there’s always a next time to look
forward to,” said Miss Leslie, with her bright smile.
“We’ve all had a delightful afternoon to look back
upon. I hope you won’t forget me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed we won’t!” cried Dulcie and Daisy both
together, and Molly added, plaintively:</p>

<p>“Oh, have you got to go back to California,
too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, Mother and I are leaving to-night, on
the same train with Mr. Maitland. But I want you
to remember me, for I have an idea that we shall
meet again some day, and in the meantime I wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
if you would write to me occasionally. I love to
get letters from little girls.”</p>

<p>“We’d love to,” said Daisy, blushing with pleasure.
“We none of us write very well except Dulcie,
but if you wouldn’t mind a few mistakes in spelling——”</p>

<p>Miss Leslie said she wouldn’t mind in the least,
and by that time Mary had opened the front door,
in answer to Uncle Stephen’s ring, and the good-byes
had to be said.</p>

<p>“I feel just the way I’m sure Cinderella must
have felt when she got back from the ball,” remarked
Dulcie, throwing herself wearily on the
nursery sofa. “That’s the only trouble about having
good times; everything seems so dull when
they’re over.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said cheerful Daisy. “Just
think what fun we’re going to have talking it all
over. I don’t think we shall ever feel quite so
lonely again, now that we know Uncle Stephen and
Miss Leslie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what good they can be to us away
off in California,” objected Molly, who was sharing
some of Dulcie’s depression.</p>

<p>“But we’ve promised to write to them both,”
argued Daisy, “and that will be very interesting.
I wonder how soon it will do to write our first
letter.”</p>

<p>“I think we might write just a short one to Uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Stephen to-morrow,” said Molly. “It would be
polite to tell him again what a beautiful time we
had, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>Nobody answered, and there was a short silence,
which Maud broke.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I want any dinner,” she remarked,
with a long sigh. “There’s going to be corned
beef, there always is on Saturday, and I hate corned
beef. I’d like some more ice-cream, but I don’t
want anything else to eat. My head aches, and I
think I’m going to have another sore throat.”</p>

<small>THE SINGING LADY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MAUD’S sore throats were one of the greatest
trials to her sisters. Not only were
they of frequent occurrence, but they
were always regarded by Grandma in the light of an
especial grievance to herself, for which somebody
must be held responsible. If Maud had lived in the
present day, some doctor would probably have decided
that her tonsils needed to be removed, but in
1880 people did not think so much about operations,
and the family physician contented himself with prescribing
simple remedies, and the advice that the
child should be kept out of draughts, and not allowed
to get her feet wet. Maud’s prediction on the present
occasion proved only too true. In the middle of
the night Daisy was aroused by a feverish demand
from her little sister, for a drink of water, and by
morning Maud could not swallow without considerable
difficulty, and the too familiar white spots had
appeared on her throat. Of course Grandma had to
be told, and the consequence was a severe lecture to
the other three, which lasted all through breakfast.</p>

<p>“I might have known what would happen when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
I let you all go off yesterday,” grumbled Mrs. Winslow,
as she prepared Maud’s gargle in the nursery
after breakfast. “I don’t suppose it ever occurred
to one of you to see that the child did not sit in her
warm coat all the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Miss Leslie made her take off her coat,” protested
Daisy, “and I don’t really think she got over-heated
or anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, she evidently caught cold in some way.
At any rate, this has taught me a lesson. Now remember,
Maud, you are to gargle your throat regularly
every two hours, and take one of these powders
every hour. If I hear of your getting out of bed I
shall punish you severely.”</p>

<p>“Who is going to stay with Maud this morning,
Grandma?” Daisy asked, following Mrs. Winslow
out into the hall. “I suppose one of us will have
to stay home from church.”</p>

<p>Grandma reflected for a moment. She was very
particular about church-going, but under the present
circumstances it was evident that Maud could not
be left alone.</p>

<p>“I think you and Daisy had better come to church
with me,” she said. “Maud doesn’t need anything
except her gargle and the powders, and Molly can
attend to them.”</p>

<p>So it was settled, much to Molly’s satisfaction,
and at half-past ten Dulcie and Daisy departed for
church, with Grandma and Aunt Kate, and the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
younger children were left to themselves. Maud,
who was feverish and rather cross, was inclined to
resent this arrangement, which deprived her of the
society of her two older sisters.</p>

<p>“I want Dulcie to stay and tell me stories,” she
pleaded. “Nobody can tell stories but Dulcie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you stories this afternoon,” said Dulcie.
“I don’t believe Grandma will make me go to church
twice to-day, on account of your being sick.”</p>

<p>“But I want stories this morning,” fretted Maud;
“I want to hear about Mamma. Ask Grandma to
let you stay at home instead of Molly.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be any use; it would only make her
crosser than she is already. Molly will read to you.
There’s a very nice book I got from the library. It’s
called ‘Ministering Children,’ and it’s a regular Sunday
story.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the way Molly reads,” complained
the invalid. “She can’t pronounce the long words,
and she keeps stopping to spell things. I can read
’most as well as she can myself.”</p>

<p>But whether Maud liked it or not, there was nothing
to be done, as they all knew well. Grandma
never changed her mind about things, and when she
had once given an order she expected implicit obedience.</p>

<p>“I’ll do anything you want me to,” said Molly,
good-naturedly, as the retreating footsteps of the
church-goers died away in the distance. “We can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
play lotto, because it’s Sunday, but perhaps it
wouldn’t be wicked to cut out some paper dolls.”</p>

<p>Maud brightened a little at this suggestion, and
for the next half-hour all went well. Then it was
time for Maud’s medicine, and she began to rebel.</p>

<p>“I don’t like those nasty powders, and I’m not
going to take any more till Grandma comes home.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall both get an awful scolding,” said
Molly, desperately. “Grandma knows just how
many powders there are, and she’ll count to see if
you’ve taken them all right. Do swallow this one,
like a good girl, and I’ll give you a drink of water to
take away the taste.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Maud realized the force of her sister’s
argument. At any rate, she made no further objection
to swallowing the medicine, over which she
made a wry face.</p>

<p>“When I grow up, I’m never going to take medicine,”
she announced, decidedly. “I’m not going to
do a single thing I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll have to,” said Molly. “Grown-up
people can’t always do just as they like. Papa
didn’t want to go to China and leave us all, but he
had to, and Lizzie didn’t want to go away. Listen,
the lady next door is beginning to sing.”</p>

<p>Maud’s face brightened.</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” she said. “She always sings hymns
on Sunday. I wonder why she doesn’t go to church.
Maybe she’s sick, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>For ten minutes the room was very still, while the
two children listened to the music, which reached
them distinctly through the party wall. Then Maud
began to show signs of restlessness again.</p>

<p>“I wish she’d sing ‘Only an Armor-Bearer,’” she
complained, fretfully. “‘Only an Armor-Bearer’
is my favorite hymn; it’s got such a nice, lively tune.
She ’most always sings it on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she will in a little while,” said Molly,
and again there was silence. But, contrary to their
expectations, the lady next door did not sing “Only
an Armor-Bearer,” and after a few minutes the
music ceased.</p>

<p>“O dear!” cried Maud, “now she’s stopped, and
I did want ‘Only an Armor-Bearer’ so much.
Can’t we ask her to sing some more?”</p>

<p>“Why, Maud, how could we? We don’t know
her. Oh, Maud, don’t begin to cry. You’ll be
worse if you do.”</p>

<p>“I am worse now,” declared Maud, seizing eagerly
upon this new idea. “I’m much worse.
Maybe I’m going to die and go to heaven, like
Mamma. If I do you’ll be sorry you wouldn’t ask
the lady to sing ‘Only an Armor-Bearer.’”</p>

<p>“But how can I ask her, Maudie? It would be
dreadfully rude to call through the wall, and I don’t
believe she’d understand, anyway. If I went in
next door I should have to ring the bell to get back,
and then Mary would see me, and she’d be sure to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
tell Grandma. Besides, I wouldn’t know whom
to ask for. We don’t even know the lady’s
name.”</p>

<p>Maud stopped crying, and raised herself on one
elbow.</p>

<p>“If you’ll promise never to tell Grandma,” she
said, “I’ll tell you something. It’s my secret; I’ve
had it for ever so many days.”</p>

<p>“A secret! What kind of a secret?” Molly
was beginning to be interested.</p>

<p>“It’s a very lovely secret,” said Maud, proudly.
“You big ones are always having secrets, so I got
one, too. I won’t tell it, though, unless you promise
not to tell Grandma.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll promise. You know I never tell
Grandma things, or Aunt Kate either.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that we ought to tell Dulcie and
Daisy,” said Maud, doubtfully; “they might think
Grandma ought to know. That’s why I didn’t talk
about it. It was so exciting. I peeked in, but I
was scared to go any farther.”</p>

<p>“Peeked in?” repeated Molly; “where did you
peek in?”</p>

<p>“Next door. Through the door in the trunk-room,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the door Grandpa had cut between
the houses when Uncle George lived next door? I
thought it was locked up after Uncle George died,
and the boarding-house people came there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“It isn’t locked up,” said Maud, triumphantly.
“I found out, and that’s my secret.”</p>

<p>“Maud!” gasped Molly, her eyes round with astonishment.
“You mean you knew such an exciting
thing, and never told any one.”</p>

<p>Maud nodded.</p>

<p>“I wanted to have a secret,” she said, “and I
was afraid Dulcie or Daisy would tell Grandma. It
was the last time I had a cold, and Grandma
wouldn’t let me go out. I was up here playing all
by myself. I was looking for my littlest china doll.
I couldn’t find her, and I thought perhaps I’d left
her in the trunk-room the day we played Libby
Prison in there, so I went to look. I did find her
behind one of the biggest trunks, and then I saw the
door. I thought it was locked, of course, but I
shook the handle just for fun, and all of a sudden it
came open, and I looked right in next door.”</p>

<p>“What did you see?” demanded Molly, in a tone
of breathless interest.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see very much,” confessed Maud, reluctantly.
“It was just a big closet, and there were
brooms and dust-pans in it, but it really was next
door. First I was going to tell, but then I was
afraid if Grandma knew she’d have the door locked
up right away, and then we could never go to see
the singing lady.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure Grandma would have it locked right
up,” said Molly, “and perhaps the lady who keeps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the boarding-house would, too, but it’s very interesting
to know it isn’t locked now. Why, it must have
been unlocked all the time since Uncle George died,
and nobody ever found it out before. I don’t believe
the people next door know it any more than
we did.”</p>

<p>“Of course they don’t,” said Maud, “that’s what
makes it so interesting. Now you see you can go
to see the singing lady just as easy as anything, and
ask her to sing ‘Only an Armor-Bearer.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, Maud, I couldn’t,” protested Molly; “it
would be such a very queer thing to do. The lady
might not like it a bit, and Grandma would make
such a fuss. She never lets us talk to people she
doesn’t know.”</p>

<p>“You promised you wouldn’t tell Grandma, and
I know the singing lady wouldn’t be angry. You’ve
got to do it, Molly, or else maybe I’ll die and go to
heaven.”</p>

<p>Molly hesitated. It would certainly be a thrilling
experience to go uninvited, and without even ringing
the door-bell, into the house next door, that mysterious
boarding-house, upon whose occupants
Grandma and Aunt Kate looked down from their
height of social superiority. Molly loved adventure,
and yet—what would Grandma say? Would
even Dulcie and Daisy altogether approve? Maud
noticed the hesitation in her sister’s manner, and
was quick to take advantage of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“If you won’t go,” she announced, sitting up in
bed, “I’ll get right straight up and go myself.”</p>

<p>Molly rose irresolutely.</p>

<p>“If I go, will you promise faithfully not to get
out of bed for a single minute till I come back?”</p>

<p>Maud nodded emphatically.</p>

<p>“I’ll promise, cross my heart, and that’s the solemnest
promise anybody can make, and if you break
it something awful will happen to you. Mary told
me it would. I’ll lie just as still, as still, and when
you come back you can tell me all about the singing
lady.”</p>

<p>“And will you gargle and take your powders all
day without making any more fuss?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll give you my best paper doll, and
all her dresses. Don’t you think I’m kind?”</p>

<p>Molly moved slowly towards the door.</p>

<p>“It seems an awful thing to do,” she said, “but
I’ll only stay a minute, and I can’t let you get out of
bed.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Molly’s heart was beating very fast as she crossed
the hall to the dark room, which Grandma used for
storing trunks and boxes. There was no one to see
her, for both the servants were in the kitchen, and
she and Maud had the upper part of the house quite
to themselves. The trunk-room was not locked,
and she made her way amid various impediments,
to the heavy door, which she had always known
communicated with the adjoining house. Old Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Winslow had had it made in days gone by, when the
house next door had belonged to his only brother, of
whom he was very fond. This brother had died
before the children came to New York, and although
the house still belonged to the Winslow family, it
had been rented to a lady, who took boarders, much
to the disgust of Grandma and Aunt Kate, who
looked upon a boarding-house as a blot on the neighborhood.
Molly was telling herself that her little
sister must have made a mistake. It did not seem
possible that the communicating door could have
been left unfastened all these years, without the fact
having been discovered. With a trembling hand
she turned the knob. The door stuck a little, and
she was just about to turn away, convinced that
Maud had dreamed the whole thing, when suddenly
the door swung open, so quietly and easily, that, in
her astonishment, she nearly fell over backward.</p>

<p>There, sure enough, was the closet, just as Maud
had described it. Molly fairly gasped, and in that
one moment everything else was forgotten in the
excitement of the wonderful discovery she had
made. She did not shrink back, as Maud had done,
but pushing her way through brooms and brushes,
and stumbling over various articles on the floor,
reached another door, which she opened, and the
next moment she had stepped out into a hall, which
was exactly like the hall of their own top floor.</p>

<p>It was very quiet, and there was no one to be seen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Molly closed the closet door softly, and stood looking
about her. There were four rooms on the floor,
and all the doors were closed. The singing lady’s
room was in the front, she knew, and after one moment’s
hesitation, she stepped boldly forward, and
knocked.</p>

<p>“Come in,” called a pleasant voice, and there was
a sound as of some piece of furniture being moved
rapidly along the floor. Before Molly could quite
make up her mind to turn the handle, the door was
opened from the inside, and a little lady in a wheel-chair
suddenly confronted her.</p>

<p>She was such a tiny lady that for the first moment
Molly thought she must be a child, but when the
pleasant voice spoke again, it sounded oddly familiar.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come in?” she said, and the face that
looked at Molly from the wheel-chair was so very
sweet and winning, that half her embarrassment
melted away at once.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll excuse me for coming,” she faltered,
“but—but, you see, we live next door, and
my little sister is sick. We can hear you sing
through the wall, and we all love it. My sister
wants me to ask if you won’t please sing ‘Only an
Armor-Bearer,’ because it’s her favorite hymn.”</p>

<p>“Come right in,” said the lady, hospitably, “and
would you mind closing the door? The halls are
rather chilly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Molly complied, and found herself in a room exactly
like their own nursery on the other side of the
wall. Indeed, the two houses had been built at the
same time, and were alike in every particular. It
was evidently used as both bed and sitting-room, for
a piano stood between the windows, and by the
empty fireplace stood a small mahogany bookcase
well filled with rather shabby-looking books. The
room might have been more tidy, for the bed was
still unmade, and on the table was a tray containing
the remains of a breakfast, but the lady herself was
as neat as possible, although her blue wrapper was
somewhat faded, and the slippers on the little feet
that hung helplessly over the edge of the wheel-chair
had long ago lost their first freshness.</p>

<p>“You must excuse things being a little upset,”
the lady said, apologetically. “It’s Sunday morning,
you know, and the chambermaid has gone to
church. She’s a nice girl, and very kind and obliging,
but I am afraid I give her a good deal of
trouble. Take those bedclothes off that comfortable
chair, and sit down. It’s a great pleasure to
have a little girl come to see me. And so your
sister likes my singing. I am very glad. I had no
idea any one cared about it.”</p>

<p>“We all like it,” said Molly, who had obeyed her
hostess’ instructions, and seated herself. “You see,
our room is just on the other side of the wall,
and we can hear very well indeed. Maud is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
bed to-day, with a sore throat, and she loved the
music.”</p>

<p>“Bless her heart!” cried the little lady, fairly
beaming with pleasure, “she shall have all the music
I can give her. I love to sing, though I know I
haven’t much of a voice. Would you mind telling
me your name?”</p>

<p>“My name is Molly Winslow,” said Molly, “and
my sisters’ names are Dulcie, Daisy and Maud. It’s
Maud who is sick. She’s only seven. I’m nine,
and Dulcie and Daisy are eleven and ten. Our
mamma is dead, and our papa has gone to China.
We live next door with Grandma Winslow.”</p>

<p>“I know who you are now,” said the lady, smiling;
“you are old Dr. Winslow’s grandchildren. I
have always admired your grandfather’s writing so
much. I have read a number of his books, and I
was so much interested when I heard his house was
next door.”</p>

<p>“Were you?” said Molly. “I’m glad you like
Grandpa’s books. I didn’t know anybody did.
Dulcie began one once, but she said it wasn’t very
interesting. I suppose people ought to like their
relations’ books.”</p>

<p>The lady laughed such a merry laugh that Molly
found herself laughing, too, though she did not
know why.</p>

<p>“I think Dr. Winslow’s books might seem rather
dull to a little girl,” she said. “Perhaps I might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
have found them dull myself, if I were able to get
about like other people, but when one has to live in
a wheel-chair one is glad of almost anything to
read.”</p>

<p>“Do you always have to stay in the chair?”
asked Molly, sympathetically. “I thought perhaps
you had just sprained your ankle or something like
that. Papa sprained his ankle once and he had to
keep his foot up for three whole weeks.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t walked a step for nearly three years,”
said the lady, quietly.</p>

<p>“Can’t you even go up and down stairs?”</p>

<p>The lady shook her head.</p>

<p>“I was carried up here the day I left the hospital,”
she said, sadly, “and I have lived in this
room ever since. I shall never walk again, the doctors
tell me. But I manage to get on very well,”
she added, brightening at sight of Molly’s distressed
face. “You would really be surprised to know all
the things I can do without getting out of my chair.
Then people are very kind to me. Miss Collins, the
lady who keeps this house, was an old friend of my
mother’s, and she often comes to sit with me in the
evening. The chambermaid helps me in many little
ways, and with my books, and my dear piano, I
really get on very comfortably indeed.”</p>

<p>Molly was deeply impressed.</p>

<p>“Could you walk when you were a little girl?”
she inquired, anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>A shadow crossed the lady’s sweet face.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, indeed,” she said. “I walked just like
any one else till three years ago, when I met with my
accident.”</p>

<p>“What sort of an accident was it?” Molly was
so much interested that she quite forgot that some
people might have considered her questions rather
impertinent.</p>

<p>“I was run over, crossing Broadway one very
slippery day. The ground was covered with ice,
and I fell in the middle of the street. Before I
could get on my feet again, a horse-car came around
the corner, and the driver could not stop his horses
in time. It really wasn’t anybody’s fault.”</p>

<p>Molly rose. She was beginning to feel embarrassed
again. There was something in the sight of
the helpless little figure in the wheel-chair that made
her feel all at once as if she wanted to cry.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I must go,” she said a trifle unsteadily.
“I can’t leave Maud any longer. I’m awfully
glad I know you, and the others will be so interested
when I tell them about you.”</p>

<p>“And I am delighted to know you, too,” her new
acquaintance said, heartily. “I have been more interested
in my little neighbors than you might suppose.
You see, I can hear your voices through the
wall, just as you hear my singing, and when one
spends a good deal of time alone, one gets interested
in all sorts of little things. I hope you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
will come to see me again, and bring all your little
sisters.”</p>

<p>“We’d love to come,” declared Molly. “Will
you please tell me your name in case we should want
to ask for you at the front door?”</p>

<p>“My name is Oliver, Mary Oliver, but everybody
calls me Miss Polly, and I like it much better. My
brother Tom always called me Polly. I am sorry
you must go so soon, for it is a great treat to have
a visitor, but I suppose you mustn’t leave your little
sister any longer. I hope you will find things in
better order the next time you come. Maggie is
really very good about keeping the room neat, but
Sunday morning——” And Miss Polly glanced
regretfully at the unmade bed and the tray of breakfast
dishes.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said Molly, holding out her hand.</p>

<p>Miss Polly shook the little hand—her own hand
was not much bigger—and then she looked at her
visitor rather anxiously.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid of taking cold without any
wrap?” she questioned. “To be sure it is only
next door.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t have to go out in the street at all,”
said Molly, unthinkingly. “I came through the
door in the wall.”</p>

<p>“The door in the wall?” repeated Miss Polly,
looking puzzled. “What door do you mean, dear?”</p>

<p>Molly blushed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“I didn’t mean to tell,” she said, “because it’s a
secret. It’s a door that was cut between the two
houses when Grandpa’s brother lived here. Everybody
thinks it’s locked, but it isn’t. It’s such fun
coming that way—like doing a thing in a book, you
know.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“What a delightful way to come,” she said. “I
won’t mention your secret to a soul, and you must
often come to see me through the wall.” She
looked so young and pretty, with her face all dancing
with merriment, that Molly felt suddenly as if
she were sharing a secret with a little girl of her
own age.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell Dulcie and Daisy as soon as they come
home from church,” she promised, “and I know
they’ll want to come and see you right away.” And
then she hurried off.</p>

<p>As she entered the nursery, a few minutes later,
the strains of “Only an Armor-Bearer” could be
distinctly heard through the wall, and Miss Polly’s
piano was playing a lively accompaniment to the
familiar tune.</p>

<small>MISS POLLY’S STORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“OF course, if Grandma should ever ask us,
we should have to tell her, but if she
doesn’t—and I don’t really believe she
will—I don’t see why it’s our duty to say anything
about it.”</p>

<p>Dulcie spoke in a tone of settled conviction, the
result of long considering on the subject, and her
verdict was received by her three younger sisters
with unmistakable satisfaction. For three days,
“Molly’s adventure,” as Daisy called it, had been
the chief topic of conversation in the nursery. From
the moment when, on their return from church on
Sunday morning, Molly and Maud had poured the
wonderful story into their incredulous ears, Dulcie
and Daisy had thought of little else. Many and
long had been the discussions, always held in low
voices, and in the seclusion of their own room. At
first Daisy had been of the opinion that Grandma
must be told. “Suppose a burglar should make his
way through the mysterious door some night,” she
suggested, “and carry off the family silver!” But
this objection to the keeping of their secret had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
overruled by Molly, who pointed out that the burglar
would first be obliged to break into the house next
door, and that it was most unlikely that he would
discover the existence of the door in the wall. The
people in the boarding-house were certainly not
burglars, and as nobody had ever thought of opening
the door before, why were they not as safe now
as they had ever been? Still Daisy was not altogether
convinced, and it was only after many hours
of doubt and uncertainty that she finally yielded to
the strong persuasions of her sisters.</p>

<p>“Just think, it’s the first real secret we ever had,”
pleaded Molly.</p>

<p>“It was my secret first,” chimed in Maud, “and
I needn’t have told any of you if I hadn’t wanted
to. If you tell, Daisy, I think you’re the meanest
girl in the world.” And Maud—who was still feeling
rather poorly—began to cry.</p>

<p>But at last even Daisy ceased to protest. One
stipulation she made, however, and that was to be
allowed to write the whole story to Papa.</p>

<p>“If Papa says we can keep the secret,” she said,
“it will be all right, but if he thinks Grandma ought
to know, we shall have to tell her.”</p>

<p>“It will take a long time to get an answer from
China,” said Dulcie, cheerfully, “and Papa always
understands things.”</p>

<p>So Daisy wrote her letter, and felt decidedly more
comfortable after it was mailed. And now it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Wednesday night, and the children were enjoying
the rare treat of an evening to themselves. Grandma
and Aunt Kate had gone to dine with their minister
and his wife, and were to attend a missionary meeting
afterwards, so as soon as they finished their
rather meager supper, they had retired to their own
premises, which was more agreeable than spending a
silent evening down-stairs. For the past fifteen minutes,
they had been eagerly discussing the propriety
of making a call on their interesting next-door
neighbor.</p>

<p>“You promised to take me just as soon as I was
well enough,” pleaded Maud, “and I’m all well now.
Grandma says I may go out to-morrow if it doesn’t
rain. I think we ought to go and thank her for
being so kind. She sang ‘Only an Armor-Bearer’
six times on Sunday, and she’s sung all my favorite
week-day songs, too.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s our duty to go,” said Molly, virtuously.
“Girls in books always go to see cripples
and invalids. They read the Bible to them, and
bring them nice things to eat. Perhaps we could
‘minister’ to her, like that girl in ‘Ministering
Children.’”</p>

<p>“We haven’t any nice things to take her to eat,”
said Daisy, with a sigh. “We might read the Bible
to her, though. Did she seem like a very religious
lady, Molly?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Molly. “She didn’t talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
about religious things, but I’m sure she’s very good.
She said she loved her books, so perhaps she’d
rather read the Bible to herself.”</p>

<p>“I think she must be like ‘Cousin Helen’ in
‘What Katy Did,’” decided Dulcie. “You know
she was always very cheerful, and everybody loved
her. I don’t remember that she was particularly
religious. I feel perfectly sure Papa would like to
have us go to see her.”</p>

<p>“Of course he would,” affirmed Molly, with conviction.
“Grandma wouldn’t, though, because she
never wants us to go and see anybody. I think
sometimes Grandma just tries to be disagreeable.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we ought to say such things,” said
Daisy, gravely. “You know what Papa told us
about being loyal.”</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t have to be loyal to Grandma
when we’re all by ourselves,” retorted Molly. “It’s
hard enough to remember when we’re with people,
like Uncle Stephen and Miss Leslie. We can say
what we like to each other, and it’s a great comfort.”</p>

<p>“Don’t argue, children,” reproved Dulcie, in her
elder sister tone. “I’ve thought it over a lot, and
I’ve decided that it really is our duty to go and call
on the singing lady.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go now, right away,” exclaimed Maud,
joyfully, springing to her feet.</p>

<p>Dulcie glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>“It’s only a little after seven,” she said, reflectively.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
“Mary’s out, and Bridget never comes up-stairs
till bedtime. Yes, I think we might go now.”</p>

<p>“Come along, then,” cried Maud, already half-way
to the door. She was promptly followed by
Molly, and Daisy, though still a little reluctant, did
not linger far behind. But Dulcie still hesitated.</p>

<p>“We ought to take her a present,” she said.
“People always take presents to cripples.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a present?” Molly inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>“Flowers, or a Bible, or—or—oh, I don’t know
exactly; something very nice and appropriate.”</p>

<p>The other three glanced helplessly around the
room, and their faces fell.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t any flowers,” said Molly, “and
I’m quite sure Miss Polly has a Bible. We couldn’t
give her ours, anyway, because it belonged to
Mamma. I don’t believe we really have to take a
present, Dulcie. I think she’ll be glad to see us,
even if we haven’t got anything for her.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose she’d care for a paper doll?”
suggested Maud. “Of course I know she’s a
grown-up lady, but if she has to sit still in a chair
all the time, she might enjoy cutting out paper
dresses. I’d take her my prettiest one if you think
she’d like it.”</p>

<p>Dulcie and Molly laughed, and Daisy said
kindly:</p>

<p>“I’m afraid a paper doll wouldn’t do, Maudie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
though it was very sweet of you to think of it.
We’ll have to go without a present this time, but
perhaps we can make her a book-mark, or something
like that, before we go again.”</p>

<p>That question being settled, there seemed nothing
further to wait for, so, with fast-beating hearts, the
four little girls set forth on their adventure. At the
trunk-room door Maud drew back.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it was going to be so dark,” she
protested. “I don’t like dark places.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Dulcie, impatiently. “Keep
hold of Daisy’s hand, and you won’t be scared.”
And, as the eldest member of the party, Dulcie advanced
firmly into the trunk-room.</p>

<p>It required some fumbling to discover the knob of
the mysterious door, as the only light was the dim
reflection from a single gas-jet in the hall, but when
found it turned easily, and the next moment they
had plunged into the still greater darkness of the
housemaid’s closet next door.</p>

<p>Molly tumbled over a step-ladder, and Maud uttered
a suppressed scream, but Dulcie pressed on
steadily ahead.</p>

<p>“This is the way out,” she announced in an excited
whisper; “I feel the door. Oh, I hope it isn’t
locked. No, it’s all right; here’s the handle. Oh!”
And, with a great gasp, Dulcie stepped out into the
lighted hall of the boarding-house.</p>

<p>“That’s her room,” whispered Molly, pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
to one of the closed doors. “Shall I knock, or will
you, Dulcie?”</p>

<p>“You’d better,” said Dulcie. “You know her,
and we don’t. Be sure not to forget to introduce
us.”</p>

<p>Molly stepped forward, and for the second time,
tapped softly at the “singing lady’s” door. There
was a moment’s pause, and then the sweet voice they
had all so often heard singing the old-fashioned
ballads they loved, called a cheerful “Come in,” and
Molly turned the handle.</p>

<p>Miss Polly was in her wheel-chair, which had been
pushed under the rather high chandelier in the centre
of the room. She had evidently been reading, but
at the children’s entrance she laid down her book,
and with a little cry of pleasure, held out both hands
in greeting.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s my little neighbors from next door,”
she said joyfully. “Oh, but I am glad to see you,
dears. And did you all come through the door in
the wall?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we did,” said Molly; and, mindful of
Dulcie’s instruction, she added, primly, “These are
my three sisters; Dulcie, Daisy, and Maud. We
came to thank you for being so kind about singing
while Maud was in bed, with her sore throat.”</p>

<p>“You are all most welcome, I am sure,” said Miss
Polly, heartily, her pretty face fairly beaming with
pleasure. “It’s never any trouble to me to sing. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
love music more than almost anything else in the
world. I would like to be at my piano all day if it
were not for fear of troubling the other boarders.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it couldn’t trouble anybody,” said
Dulcie, politely. “We love it.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind to say so, dear, but you see
people don’t all feel the same way about things.
There was an old gentleman on this floor last year
who objected very much. He said music made him
nervous, and threatened to leave if he ever heard the
piano when he was in his room. Miss Collins was
very sorry, but of course she couldn’t run the risk
of losing a boarder, so I had to be very careful.
Fortunately, he has gone away now, and the young
man who occupies the room this winter is scarcely
ever at home. Now, won’t you all sit down and
make me a nice little visit? I expected to be alone
all the evening, for Miss Collins told me she was
going to the theatre, and she is about my only visitor.
I am sorry I haven’t more chairs to offer you.
You see, I have so few visitors, it seemed foolish to
waste chairs, so I let Miss Collins take some that
belonged in this room and use them somewhere else.
Perhaps two of you won’t object to sitting on the
bed.”</p>

<p>“We like sitting on beds very much,” remarked
Maud, as she and Molly had promptly seated themselves.
“Your bed is made up now, isn’t it?
Molly said it wasn’t the other day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Maud!” cried Molly, blushing, but Miss Polly
only smiled.</p>

<p>“That was because the chambermaid had gone to
church,” she explained. “Maggie is a nice girl,
and does many kind things for me every day, but
she is very busy, and sometimes I have to wait a
little while, which is only right and natural.”</p>

<p>“You must excuse Maud,” apologized Dulcie.
“She doesn’t mean to be rude, but she isn’t eight
yet. I think this is a very pretty room. May I
look at your books? I love books.”</p>

<p>“To be sure you may, and borrow any that you
like. I am afraid a good many of my books are
rather dry for a little girl, but I have ‘The Wide
Wide World,’ and ‘The Lamplighter,’ and Grace
Aguilar’s works. You might enjoy some of
those.”</p>

<p>Dulcie went over to the bookcase, and was soon
absorbed in examining its contents, but the other
three remained in their seats, and prepared to make
themselves agreeable.</p>

<p>“It’s been a very pleasant day,” observed Dulcie,
by way of starting the conversation. “We’ve been
playing in the square. We often go there to play.”</p>

<p>“It must be a very pleasant place to play in,”
said Miss Polly. “I sometimes wish this house
was opposite the park, for it would be so pleasant to
see the green trees in summer. But one cannot have
everything, and I am so comfortable here, in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
nice room, that it doesn’t seem quite right to wish
for anything more.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever go out at all?” asked Daisy,
and she looked so distressed that Miss Polly hastened
to say cheerfully:</p>

<p>“Well, no, dear. You see, it couldn’t be managed
very easily. It would be very difficult to get
my chair down all these stairs, even if there were
any one to carry me, which of course there isn’t.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you could be very heavy,” said
Molly, with a critical glance at the tiny figure in the
wheel-chair. “If somebody carried you down-stairs,
couldn’t you go for a drive in a carriage?
Central Park is lovely, and there are beautiful trees
there. Lizzie, our nurse, used to take us to Central
Park very often. We went on the Sixth Avenue
elevated road, and it was great fun, but I don’t suppose
you could go that way.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly smiled rather sadly.</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” she said. “A carriage would
be different, but carriages cost money, you know.”</p>

<p>“I wish we had a carriage,” said Daisy, regretfully.
“We’d take you out every day if we had.
Papa had a horse and carriage when we lived in
Danby, before Mamma died, but that was a long
time ago. We don’t mind not having one ourselves,
because we like the stages and the elevated just as
well, but it would be lovely to take you to Central
Park.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Thank you, dear, but I appreciate the kind
thought just as much as I should the drive. There
is just one reason why I should like to be able to get
out occasionally; it would give me more to write
about in my letters to Tom.”</p>

<p>“Who is Tom?” inquired Daisy, with interest.</p>

<p>“My dear brother; the only near relative I have
in the world. I write to him every week, and sometimes
it is a little difficult to make my letters interesting.
Tom isn’t particularly fond of books, and I
am afraid it might bore him to hear about what I am
reading. Sometimes I am almost afraid he may
begin to suspect that I don’t get about as I used to.”</p>

<p>“Why, doesn’t he know?” gasped Daisy; and
Dulcie, who had been glancing over “A Mother’s
Recompense,” suddenly closed her book, and regarded
Miss Polly with increased interest.</p>

<p>Miss Polly blushed, and looked a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>“No, dear, he doesn’t,” she confessed. “You
see, I have never been able to bring myself to the
point of telling him. You see, he was in Chicago
when I met with my accident, and he had just written
me of his engagement to such a dear girl. He
was so happy, and if he had known about me, it
would have spoiled everything. Tom is such a
sweet, unselfish boy. Nothing in the world would
have kept him away from me. He would have
given up his position, where he was doing so well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
and come home to take care of me. I couldn’t let
him do that, now, could I? Of course, he had to be
told of the accident, but I wouldn’t let any one write
him how serious it was, and when I left the hospital,
and was able to write myself, he thought I was quite
well again. I meant to tell him later, but somehow
the right time never seemed to come. Tom and
Helen are married now, and have a baby, a dear
little girl, whom they have named for me. I was so
happy when that news came that I cried—wasn’t I
silly?”</p>

<p>“But doesn’t your brother ever come to see
you?” Dulcie asked.</p>

<p>“He would if he could, dear, but he can’t leave
his business very well, and besides, it costs a good
deal to come all the way from Chicago to New York
and back. He sends me presents, though, such
beautiful presents, and last summer, after the baby
came, he and Helen wanted me to come and make
them a long visit. He offered to pay all my expenses,
and Helen wrote me such a cordial invitation.
Of course, I couldn’t go, and I had to pretend
that I was too busy to leave New York. You
see, Tom thinks I am still giving music lessons, as I
did before my accident.”</p>

<p>“But that isn’t true,” objected Daisy, looking
rather shocked.</p>

<p>A shadow crossed Miss Polly’s bright face.</p>

<p>“I know it, dear,” she said, with a sigh, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
that’s the hardest part of it all. My father was a
minister, and Tom and I were brought up always to
speak the truth. It worries me a great deal to have
to deceive Tom as I do, but even that seems better
than being a burden to him, as I should be if he
knew the truth. He had such a hard struggle at
first, but he is doing splendidly now, and he and
Helen are so ideally happy. They have just bought
a little house on the Lake Shore, in one of the prettiest
suburbs of Chicago. Tom sent me a photograph
of it, with Helen and the baby on the porch.
They say there’s a dear little room for me, whenever
I can spare the time to make them a visit. They
little know what a troublesome visitor I should be.”
Miss Polly’s bright voice broke suddenly, and her
sentence ended in a sigh.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you would be a troublesome visitor
at all,” said Daisy, laying a kind little hand on
Miss Polly’s knee. “I think they would just love
having you; don’t you, Dulcie?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Dulcie, “I’m perfectly sure of it.
But, Miss Polly, would you mind telling us what
you write about every week, and how you keep your
brother from finding out?”</p>

<p>Miss Polly smiled, but she looked a little troubled,
too, and the color deepened in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you will think me a very foolish
person,” she said, “but I’ll tell you all about it from
the beginning, and then perhaps you will understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
a little better. Tom and I were born in a Vermont
village, where our father was minister of the Congregational
Church for a good many years. My
mother died when we were both little, and we were
brought up by an old housekeeper, who was devoted
to us. Tom is two years older than I, and ever
since I can remember, I have loved him better than
any one else in the world. My father was a good
man, but rather stern and unapproachable, and not
particularly fond of children. Tom was a bright
boy, always full of fun and mischief, but he didn’t
care very much about study, and my father—who
was a great student himself—was constantly reproaching
him for not doing better at school. He
wanted Tom to study for the ministry, but the boy
had no taste for preaching. He went to college to
please Father, but at the end of his sophomore year
he had so many conditions to make up that Father
was very angry, and refused to let him go back the
next term, so Tom decided to go West and try to
make his fortune. That was eight years ago, and
he was just twenty then. He had rather a hard
time at first, but after a year or two, he settled in
Chicago, where he has lived ever since. He came
home twice for a visit. The last time was three
years and a half ago, when Father died. Father
wasn’t a rich man—country ministers never are rich
men—but all he had was divided equally between
Tom and me. Tom wouldn’t take a penny. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
said he was quite able to support himself, and that I
must have all Father’s money. It was very generous
of him, and I tried my best to make him take
his share, but he is an obstinate boy, and when he
has once made up his mind to do a thing, nothing in
this world will change him. So in the end I had to
give in, and he went back to Chicago. He wanted
me to go with him, but I’d set my heart on coming
to New York to study music and give lessons. Of
course, I had to leave the parsonage, where Tom and
I were born, and after spending the summer with
some friends, I came here to New York in the fall
and started work. It wasn’t quite as easy as I had
expected, but I managed to get a few pupils, and the
money I earned paid for my own lessons. I was
very happy all that winter, and then—and then I
met with my accident.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly paused for a moment, and the look in
her eyes was very sad, but when she went on again,
her voice was as cheerful as ever.</p>

<p>“Of course there was no more work for me after
that, and if it hadn’t been for the money Tom had
made me accept, things would have been much
harder than they were. I had been boarding up-town
before the accident, but when I was in the hospital,
I wrote to Miss Collins—who used to live at
Pine Brook, and was a friend of my mother’s—and
asked if she could give me a room in her house. I
thought it would be pleasanter than living with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
complete strangers. She was very kind, and offered
me this lovely room, which happened to be vacant
just then, so as soon as I was able to leave the hospital,
I was brought here, and here I have been ever
since. I have never been down-stairs since the day
I was carried up, but Miss Collins lets me have my
dear piano, and that is my greatest joy.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t told us about the letters to your
brother,” said Dulcie.</p>

<p>“I’m just coming to that, my dear. You see,
when I first came to New York, I used to write Tom
about my pupils, and he got to know their names,
and would ask questions about them in his letters.
Well, afterwards, I had to keep on writing about the
same things, or he would have thought it strange.
I have to use a good deal of imagination, because I
have never seen any of those people since my accident.”</p>

<p>“You mean you make up things,” said Dulcie,
“just as if you were writing a story.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” she said. “I used to write
stories when I was a little girl, though, of course,
none of them were worth anything. I have made
up all sorts of stories about those old pupils of mine.
I don’t know what they would say if they ever heard
of them, but they are all pleasant stories, so perhaps
they wouldn’t object very much. Sometimes I am
able to write something that is really true. One of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
the girls I taught was married this winter. I saw
an account of the wedding in the paper, and I cut it
out and sent it to Tom in a letter. I was afraid I
had made a mistake, though, when Tom wrote that
Helen wanted to know what I wore to the wedding.
I had to invent a costume, and that wasn’t easy, for
I know very little about the fashions nowadays.”
And Miss Polly glanced down at her plain blue
wrapper with a rather sad smile.</p>

<p>“I think you are the most wonderful person I
ever heard of,” declared Dulcie, with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“But just think how your brother will feel when
he finds out,” said Daisy; “he will find out sometime,
won’t he?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid he will, and that is what worries
me. There is one comfort, though; it won’t be
quite as bad as it would have been at first, for Tom
is doing better in business now, and the burden
might not seem so very great.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he would think it a burden at all,
and I think you ought to tell him, I really do,” said
Daisy, with unusual firmness.</p>

<p>Miss Polly shook her head.</p>

<p>“Not yet, dear,” she said; “some day, perhaps,
but not just yet.”</p>

<p>For a moment nobody spoke, and then Maud’s
voice broke the silence. “Won’t you please sing
‘Darby and Joan’?” she inquired in a rather
sleepy little voice. Maud was only seven, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
had not found Miss Polly’s reminiscences quite so
absorbing as her elder sisters had done.</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” said Miss Polly, and in a
moment she had pushed the wheel-chair across the
room to the piano.</p>

<p>Then followed a very pleasant half-hour. Miss
Polly sang all their favorite ballads, greatly to everybody’s
enjoyment, especially Maud’s. The little girl
quite forgot that she was sleepy, and stood by the
piano, drinking in every note, and looking so happy
that Miss Polly regarded her with growing interest.</p>

<p>“You love music, don’t you, dear?” she asked,
kindly, at the close of “Twickenham Ferry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Maud, eagerly; “I love it when
I’m on the other side of the wall, but I love it even
better when I’m on this side.”</p>

<p>Everybody laughed, and then Daisy looked at the
clock, and rose reluctantly.</p>

<p>“I’m dreadfully sorry,” she said, “but I’m afraid
we ought to go. It’s nearly half-past eight, and
Grandma always sends us to bed at eight.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly looked sorry, but made no objections.</p>

<p>“You must do as your grandmother wishes,” she
said, “but I hope you will be able to come again very
soon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we will, we will,” promised the four little
girls, and then, to every one’s surprise, Maud—who
was not usually a demonstrative child—suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
lifted her face and kissed the little lady in the wheel-chair.</p>

<p>Miss Polly fairly beamed with pleasure, and yet
there were tears in her eyes, too, as she returned
Maud’s kiss.</p>

<p>“You dear little girl!” she exclaimed, a trifle
unsteadily. “Why, no one has kissed me since—oh,
not in ever so long, and it’s so very sweet to be
loved.”</p>

<p>“May we kiss you too?” inquired Dulcie, impulsively.</p>

<p>Miss Polly held out her arms.</p>

<p>“Indeed you may,” she said, heartily. “You
have given me a beautiful evening, and it will be
quite an exciting story to write Tom next Sunday,
how four dear little neighbors came to see me,
through a mysterious door in a wall.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help whether Grandma would approve or
not,” said Dulcie, when they were back in the
nursery. “I am sure Papa and Mamma would
want us to go and see that poor dear little Miss Polly
just as often as we could. And, after all, Papa is
the person we have to mind.”</p>

<p>“He’ll know all about it when he gets my letter,”
said Daisy, in a tone of satisfaction. “I think we
might write Uncle Stephen and Miss Leslie about
it, too; I’m sure they would be interested, and they
would never tell Grandma. I know Miss Polly
must be a very lovely Christian, even if she doesn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
tell her brother every bit of the truth. Just think of
having to stay in one room all the time, and never
being able to get out of a wheel-chair. Nobody else
could bear it as she does. I’m quite sure it’s our
duty to go and see her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know which I like best, Miss Leslie or
Miss Polly,” remarked Molly, reflectively.</p>

<p>“I do,” cried Maud; “I think Miss Polly is the
loveliest lady in the world, and I’m going to ‘minister’
to her, the way you said. I don’t know what
‘ministering’ means, but I’m going to find out, and
then I’ll do it just as hard as I can.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>PAUL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was Grandma who made the exciting announcement
at the breakfast table, one morning
about ten days later.</p>

<p>“Julia is coming to New York next week,” she
remarked to Aunt Kate, looking up from a letter
she was reading, “and she wants to bring Paul with
her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how exciting!” cried Molly, dropping her
spoon into the oatmeal in the excitement of the
moment. “You’ll let them come, won’t you,
Grandma?”</p>

<p>Grandma frowned. One of her strictest rules
was that children were not to talk at meal-times.</p>

<p>“Certainly my daughter is always welcome to her
mother’s house,” she said, coldly, and Molly, very
much embarrassed, dropped her eyes to the table-cloth.</p>

<p>Julia was Grandma’s married daughter, Mrs.
Chester, who lived in Boston, and whose only child
Paul had long been a subject of considerable interest
to the four little girls. They had never seen Paul,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
but according to his mother—who generally paid
flying visits to her family in New York several times
a year—he was a very remarkable little boy. Dulcie
glanced at Aunt Kate, to see how she was taking
the news, but her somewhat inexpressive face appeared
quite unruffled.</p>

<p>“Paul hasn’t been very well, it seems,” Mrs.
Winslow went on, “and the doctor advises change
of air. Julia has taken him out of school for a
month, and wants to bring him here.”</p>

<p>“I hope Julia isn’t as fussy over the boy as she
used to be,” said Aunt Kate, buttering a slice of
toast as she spoke. “He always seemed to me
about as strong as any child of his age, and I know
his father thinks he is. He told me the last time I
was in Boston that Julia coddles Paul entirely too
much.”</p>

<p>“Well, Paul is an only child,” said Grandma,
with unusual indulgence for her. “Julia has never
recovered from the death of the other baby.”</p>

<p>Aunt Kate took up the report of the Missionary
Society, which had arrived in the morning’s mail,
and nothing more was said on the subject of the expected
guests just then, but as soon as the children
were safely out of Grandma’s presence they began
chattering all at once.</p>

<p>“Won’t it be fun to have a little boy come to stay
with us?” cried Molly, before they were half-way
up-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“I hope he will be a nice boy,” said Dulcie, a little
doubtfully. “I’m afraid he’s pretty spoiled.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it will be nice to have him even if he is
spoiled,” affirmed Daisy. “He must be an awfully
clever boy, anyway. Aunt Julia says he speaks
French and German, and he’s read, I don’t know
how many books.”</p>

<p>Molly sighed.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’ll be terribly studious,” she said,
“and it won’t do for us to say we don’t like lessons,
or he’ll think us so stupid. Still, it’s going to be
very interesting, and I’m awfully glad he’s coming.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we won’t be able to go and see Miss
Polly while he’s here,” said Daisy, regretfully.
“We can’t tell our secret to any more people, you
know.”</p>

<p>This was certainly a drawback. Going to see
Miss Polly had become one of their greatest pleasures.
They had made several calls since that first
evening, and were already growing very fond of the
brave, unselfish little woman, who bore her troubles
so uncomplainingly, and was always so bright and
merry.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Paul will be such a nice boy that we
shall be able to trust him,” Molly suggested, but
Dulcie and Daisy shook their heads.</p>

<p>For the next few days little was talked of by the
children except the arrival of the expected visitors.</p>

<p>“It’s almost like having a book person come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
stay with us,” said Molly. “We’ve heard so much
about Paul, but we didn’t think we should ever
really know him. Of course he’ll like Dulcie, she’s
so clever, but I don’t suppose he’ll care very much
about the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“He ought to like Daisy,” said Maud, “because
they’re both ten and a half. Don’t people generally
like each other when they’re just the same age?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Molly, “but we’ll find out
pretty soon, and, oh, isn’t it exciting?”</p>

<p>“A very learned boy is coming to stay with us,”
Molly—who was fond of using fine words—told
Miss Hammond, the daily governess. “He speaks
French and German, and learned the multiplication
table all by himself when he was only five. He
could read the Bible perfectly before he was seven.”</p>

<p>Molly expected Miss Hammond to be much impressed,
and was somewhat crestfallen when the
only answer she received was the not very comforting
remark that it was a pity some little girls didn’t
know their tables better.</p>

<p>It was Friday when Mrs. Chester’s letter came,
and on the following Wednesday the visitors arrived.
The four children were watching from the
parlor window, and as the cab drew up, there was a
simultaneous rush for the front door. Grandma
and Aunt Kate had gone to the station to meet the
travellers, and as the party came up the steps, all
eyes were fixed eagerly upon Paul. He was a tall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
pale boy, with a rather discontented expression, and
a shock of reddish brown hair. He was not a handsome
boy, which was something of a shock, as his
mother’s descriptions had led them to expect a sort
of young Adonis, but he shook hands politely, and
murmured a few rather unintelligible words, in answer
to Dulcie’s eager assurances of how delighted
they all were to see him. Mrs. Chester, a pale, languid
lady, who talked a great deal about her health,
greeted the little girls kindly, and then they all went
up-stairs together.</p>

<p>“May Paul come to the nursery with us?” Molly
inquired, as they reached the guest-room door.</p>

<p>“Not now,” Paul’s mother answered. “He is
tired from his journey, and must take a little rest
before dinner.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to rest; I’m not tired,” protested
Paul, in such a fretful tone that the children regarded
him in astonishment. “I want to go with
them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, darling, you must lie down first for half
an hour. You and the little girls can have a happy
time together after dinner.”</p>

<p>Paul looked anything but pleased, but was forced
to submit, and the children saw the door of the
guest-room resolutely closed against them.</p>

<p>“How funny to have to lie down in the daytime,”
said Maud, as they proceeded on their way
up-stairs. “Is Paul sick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“I think he must be rather delicate,” answered
Daisy. “Perhaps he studies too much.”</p>

<p>“But Dulcie studies a lot, too,” persisted Maud,
“and she never lies down in the daytime.”</p>

<p>“I think Aunt Julia is a very fussy lady,” said
Molly. “Don’t you remember how she always had
to take medicine before her meals the last time she
was here? She took afternoon naps, and we had to
keep very quiet while she was asleep. Perhaps she’s
fussy about Paul, too.”</p>

<p>Aunt Julia certainly was “fussy” about Paul, as
the children very soon discovered. When Paul appeared
at dinner, with a clean face, but otherwise
unchanged, his mother told Grandma that she was
obliged to be very particular about his diet.</p>

<p>“He will eat so few things,” she said. “O
dear! I have forgotten to bring down his tonic.
Don’t you want to run up-stairs for it, Paul darling?
The bottle is on mother’s bureau.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” replied Paul, with decision. “I
hate that nasty stuff, and the doctor said I wouldn’t
need to take it any more when I had a change of
air.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my boy,” remonstrated his mother, “the
doctor didn’t mean that you could leave it off at
once. Now run and bring me the bottle, like a good
child, and let these little girls see how obedient you
are.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get it if Paul is tired,” proposed Molly good-naturedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> 
and somewhat to the children’s surprise
the offer was accepted.</p>

<p>Paul swallowed the medicine, over which he made
a wry face, and dinner began.</p>

<p>“Take your soup, Paul dear,” his mother admonished
gently; “you are only playing with it.”</p>

<p>“There’s rice in it,” objected Paul; “I hate rice.”</p>

<p>Grandma frowned.</p>

<p>“Little boys should learn to eat what is put before
them, and not make remarks about their food,” she
said, reprovingly. If this remark had been addressed
to Molly or Maud, she would have been reduced
to instant submission. Not so Paul.</p>

<p>“I never eat things I don’t like,” he said, without
the slightest sign of embarrassment. “A great
many things disagree with me, don’t they,
Mother?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid they do,” answered Mrs. Chester,
with a sigh. “And that reminds me, Mother, he
must have squeezed meat every day for his lunch,
and I always let him have ice-cream at least three
times a week. The doctor considers it good for
him.”</p>

<p>Maud’s lips moved, and the other children were
sure they could read the words “Goody, goody!”
but the grown-ups noticed nothing, and if Grandma
made no promises, she at least made no objections,
which, as Molly said afterwards, was almost as good
as saying yes. It was wonderful how much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
lenient Grandma was to Paul than she had ever been
to the four little girls.</p>

<p>“Well, Paul, what have you been reading lately?”
inquired Aunt Kate, when the soup question had
been finally settled, by Mary’s taking the plate away
to the pantry, in order to remove the objectionable
rice.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered her nephew,
rather sulkily; “nothing much, I guess.”</p>

<p>“My darling Paul,” cried his mother in horrified
reproach, “what do you mean? Tell Aunt Kate at
once about all the beautiful books you have read
since you have been ill. He reads French just as
well as English, you know, Kate. You must hear
him to-morrow. What was that interesting story
you were reading on the train to-day, Paul?”</p>

<p>“<i>Sans Famille</i>,” said Paul, pronouncing the
words with a decidedly English accent.</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said Aunt Kate. “Did you enjoy
it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t pay much attention to it,” returned
Paul, unblushingly; “I hate French.”</p>

<p>Aunt Kate smiled sarcastically, and even Grandma’s
stern face relaxed a little, but Paul’s mother
looked really pained.</p>

<p>“Don’t notice him,” she said apologetically.
“Like all sensitive children, he objects to showing
off. He really adores his French books.”</p>

<p>Paul grew suddenly scarlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“I do not!” he proclaimed loudly. “I don’t
mind showing off, but I hate French books, and
most English ones, too.”</p>

<p>“That will do, Paul,” said Grandma, who could
not endure impertinence even from her only grandson.
“Children who speak in that tone are sent
away from the table.”</p>

<p>Paul looked rather surprised, but wisely refrained
from arguing the point, and the meal proceeded
without any further unpleasantness. Paul refused
to touch turnip, and informed his mother in a low
voice that he hated baked custard, but if Grandma
heard, she made no remark.</p>

<p>“May we take Paul up-stairs, Grandma?” Dulcie
inquired, eagerly, as they rose from the table.
“Perhaps he would like to play lotto.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose you may as well,” answered Mrs.
Winslow, who evidently had her doubts as to how
Paul would endure the usual evening routine in
the dining-room. “What time does he go to bed,
Julia?”</p>

<p>“Eight o’clock precisely,” her daughter answered,
“but I think he had better go a little earlier
to-night. He must be tired from the journey. Go
up-stairs with the children, darling, and Mother will
call you in half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Now we’ve really got you to ourselves at last,”
said Dulcie, joyfully, as they all went up-stairs together.
“We’ve been talking about your coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
ever since your mother’s letter came last week. You
see, we felt as if we knew you; we’ve heard so much
about you.”</p>

<p>Paul looked interested. “What sort of things
have you heard about me?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, about how clever you are; how you learned
to read the Bible when you were so little, and could
say all your tables when you were five, and—oh, lots
of interesting things.”</p>

<p>Paul grinned.</p>

<p>“I’m not very clever,” he admitted condescendingly.
“Mother likes to tell people I am, but I’m
not really. I read a good many books, but I’d much
rather play with the boys in the streets, only Mother
won’t let me. She’s afraid I’ll catch some disease.
I’ve had measles and mumps, and chickenpox, but
I’ve got to have scarlet fever and diphtheria yet, and
Mother’s terribly afraid of those two. Is this your
room, and do you all sleep here together?”</p>

<p>Dulcie admitted that they did, and Daisy added
cheerfully, as she turned up the gas:</p>

<p>“It’s a very big room, you see, and we love being
all together.”</p>

<p>Paul glanced about him rather critically.</p>

<p>“You haven’t any pictures on the walls,” he remarked.
“My room at home is full of pictures.
They’re all copies of the old masters, and Mother
makes me learn a lot of stuff about the fellows who
painted them. I hate it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“I should think it would be very interesting,” said
Dulcie. “I love to learn about people.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t if you lived with Mother. She’s
always making me learn things, and then she tells
people, and I have to show off. I say, what’s an
‘incumbrance’?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Dulcie, looking puzzled.
“What makes you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re all one, Mother said so. She
was talking to Father last night, and she said you
were all a terrible incumbrance to Grandma.”</p>

<p>Dulcie reddened.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it means,” she said, “but I’m
sure it isn’t anything nice, and I don’t think you are
very polite to repeat it. Don’t you know it isn’t
honorable to repeat things you hear people say?
Papa never allows us to do it, and he is a very honorable
man.”</p>

<p>Paul looked rather embarrassed.</p>

<p>“My father’s a very honorable man, too,” he announced,
indignantly. “He says Mother will make
a milksop of me. Do you know what a milksop
is?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” admitted Dulcie, “but I shouldn’t
like to be one.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it’s just as bad as being an incumbrance.
Anyway, you can’t help being that, and it
isn’t your fault. Father said, ‘Poor little chicks,
I’m sorry for them,’ and he wouldn’t have said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
that if it had been your fault. You’d like my
father.”</p>

<p>“We do know him,” said Daisy. “He came
with Aunt Julia once, and he brought us some candy.
We liked him ever so much, he was so kind.”</p>

<p>“Come, let’s play lotto,” interrupted Maud, who
did not find the conversation particularly interesting.
“If we don’t begin, Aunt Julia will call Paul before
we can finish a game.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Dulcie—why don’t you
come to bed?” inquired Daisy from her pillow, an
hour later.</p>

<p>“I’ll come in a minute,” her sister answered, absently.
“I’m just looking for something in the dictionary.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Then Dulcie closed
the dictionary with a bang, and in another moment
the light was out, and she had crept into bed beside
Daisy. The two younger children were already
asleep.</p>

<p>“Was it that word Paul said, you were looking
for in the dictionary?” Daisy whispered, as her sister
nestled down beside her, and slipped an arm
round her neck.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dulcie, shortly.</p>

<p>“And did you find it, and was it something very
horrid?”</p>

<p>“It was rather horrid, but not as bad as I was
afraid it might be. It means about the same thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
as being a burden. Miss Polly was afraid of being
a burden to her brother, you know, but it isn’t anything
we can help, so there isn’t any use in talking
about it. I hate to talk about disagreeable things
just before I go to sleep. I’ll tell you about that
last Christmas in Danby, and how Mamma let me
help dress the tree.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Daisy, cheerfully. “Do you
think we are going to like Paul?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Dulcie. “I was afraid he was
going to be terribly conceited and stuck-up, but he
isn’t really. He ought not to repeat things he hears
his father and mother say, but perhaps nobody has
ever told him not to. Anyhow, I’m glad he hates
showing off.”</p>

<small>THE STOLEN CHILD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“IT’S stopped snowing, and Grandma says we
may go out and play in the Square,” announced
Paul, appearing at the nursery door,
one afternoon a few days later. “Daisy and Maud
can’t go out on account of their colds, but Dulcie
and Molly can.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll come in a minute, just as soon as I
finish my letter,” said Dulcie. Molly—who was
preparing her lessons for Miss Hammond—threw
down her geography, and sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>“I love going out in the snow,” she cried, joyfully,
“only I wish we had a sled. The Van Arsdale
girls, across the way, have one and I saw them
hitching on behind a big sleigh, a little while ago, but
Grandma says it isn’t lady-like to hitch on to sleighs,
and, anyway, we haven’t got a sled.”</p>

<p>“We have great times in the Public Gardens at
home,” said Paul. “Some boys I know built a
snow fort last winter, and we used to have regular
battles. Mother wasn’t going to let me play with
them at first; she’s always so afraid I’ll take cold,
but Father made her, and it was great fun. Hurry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
up with your old letter, Dulcie. I’m so afraid
Mother may change her mind, and say I can’t go
out in the dampness. Are you writing to your
father?”</p>

<p>“No, she isn’t,” said Daisy; “she’s writing to
Miss Leslie.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Miss Leslie?”</p>

<p>“A lovely young lady we know. She lives in
California, and we only saw her once, but she
asked us to write to her. She and Uncle Stephen
took us to ‘The Pirates of Penzance.’”</p>

<p>“Is her first name Florence?” Paul inquired.</p>

<p>“Why, yes it is. How did you know?”</p>

<p>“I heard Grandma and Aunt Kate talking about
her, when I was doing my French in Mother’s room,
the other day.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know they knew her,” said Daisy, looking
very much surprised. “What were they saying
about her?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember, I wasn’t paying much attention,
but I think she’s going to marry somebody. I
was just beginning to listen when Grandma coughed,
and they stopped talking.”</p>

<p>By this time Dulcie had finished her letter, and
all the children were looking much interested.</p>

<p>“It must be Uncle Stephen,” said Dulcie. “Perhaps
he told them that night before we came down-stairs.
Oh, I do hope it is Uncle Stephen. It
would be so lovely to have Miss Leslie for an aunt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“It wouldn’t do us much good if they lived
away off in California,” said Daisy, “but then they
might come home sometimes, and invite us for a
visit.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad you and Maud can’t go out,” remarked
Paul, regarding Daisy sympathetically, as
Dulcie and Molly went to the closet for their ulsters
and rubber boots. “Don’t you suppose Grandma
would let you if you teased?”</p>

<p>“No indeed she wouldn’t,” laughed Daisy. “You
don’t know Grandma very well if you think that.
But we don’t mind staying in the house, do we,
Maud?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Maud, looking important and
mysterious. “We’re going to do something very
interesting while you’re out.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” inquired Paul,
curiously.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell; it’s a secret. It was my secret first,
but we all know it now.”</p>

<p>“I think you might tell me,” said Paul, beginning
to look offended. “It isn’t polite to have secrets
from your company.”</p>

<p>Maud looked troubled, but Daisy hastened to
intervene.</p>

<p>“Girls have lots of secrets they don’t tell boys,”
she said, pleasantly. “If you and some other boys
had a secret, you wouldn’t tell us, you know you
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Maybe I would, and maybe I wouldn’t. The
trouble about telling girls things is they never can
keep them to themselves.”</p>

<p>“How about boys keeping things to themselves?”
asked Daisy, at which seemingly innocent question
Paul grew suddenly red, and no more was said on
the subject of secrets.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chester was waiting for them in the hall.
She was looking rather worried.</p>

<p>“Now, Paul, darling,” she began anxiously, as
her small son came running down-stairs, followed
by Dulcie and Molly, “you will promise Mother to
be very careful about those dreadful crossings, won’t
you? Take good care of him, Dulcie, and don’t let
him attempt to cross while there is anything in
sight.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of him,” promised Dulcie, rather
proud of the charge, and just then Grandma’s stern
voice was heard from the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, Julia. Those children are quite
capable of taking care of themselves. They are
none of them babies. One would think to hear you
talk that you considered that boy of yours either an
infant or an idiot.”</p>

<p>“Grandma is rather a sensible old lady, even if
she does scold,” remarked Paul, as they ran down
the steps. “Mother wouldn’t have let me go out at
all if it hadn’t been for her.”</p>

<p>“Grandma doesn’t believe in people making a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
fuss about things,” was Dulcie’s rather guarded
reply, and Molly added, doubtfully:</p>

<p>“I think she’s a little kinder to you than she is
to us, but then you are her truly grandchild, and
we’re only steps.”</p>

<p>Fifth Avenue was a pretty sight that frosty afternoon.
Children who live in New York in the twentieth
century know little of the pleasures of winter,
but in 1880 life was quite different. There were
no “snow wagons” in those days, and the snow lay
where it fell until a thaw came and melted it. Small
boys and girls earned pennies by sweeping the crossings,
and after a snowstorm every one who could
manage to secure a sleigh did so, and the consequence
was that Fifth Avenue, from Washington
Square to Central Park, was lined with sleighs of
every description, from the small one-horse cutter
to the big stage sleigh, drawn by four horses. On
this February afternoon the scene was a particularly
gay one. The sun had come out, and the trees
in the Square were all glittering with snow, while
the constant tinkle of sleigh-bells filled the frosty air.</p>

<p>“I wish we could have an adventure,” said Molly,
as they paused at the corner, waiting for an opportunity
to cross. “I don’t feel a bit like just staying
in the Square, and watching other people having
fun with their sleds. Oh, look, Dulcie; there’s the
stolen child. She’s sweeping the crossing.”</p>

<p>“What stolen child?” demanded Paul, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“That ragged little girl with the broom,” said
Molly. “Generally she has a basket, and goes to
the basement doors to ask for things to eat.”</p>

<p>“How do you know she’s been stolen? Did she
tell you so?”</p>

<p>“No, we’ve never spoken to her, but we think she
must have been. She’s got blue eyes and golden
hair, just like all the stolen children in books, and
once we saw her crying. It was when the Van Arsdales’
cook slammed the basement gate in her face.
We were dreadfully sorry, but we couldn’t do anything
about it. Grandma never lets Bridget give
anything to beggars. Dulcie has made up some
wonderful stories about the stolen child.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can be sure she’s been
stolen,” said Paul, sceptically. “Any girl might cry
if she was hungry and a cook slammed a gate in her
face. I don’t see why you don’t speak to her and
find out.”</p>

<p>“We never had a chance to speak to her,” said
Dulcie. “We’ve only seen her from the window.”</p>

<p>“You can speak to her now,” said Paul, who was
fond of getting to the bottom of things. “She’s
right here, and we’re right here, too. If she really
has been stolen, and we can find her family, we may
get a big reward. You know they offered a tremendous
reward for Charlie Ross. This one’s only a
girl, so perhaps they wouldn’t pay as much for her,
but families are always awfully glad to get back a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
stolen child. I’ve just been reading about one in a
French book, and the father built a hospital, to show
his gratitude. Come on, let’s speak to the little
girl right away.”</p>

<p>Dulcie’s heart beat rather fast, and Molly was
conscious of a little thrill of excitement, as they approached
the small crossing-sweeper.</p>

<p>“She’s rather dirty,” whispered Molly. “I
thought stolen children were always very clean.”</p>

<p>“Not always,” Dulcie reassured her. “They
can’t help being dirty sometimes, when there isn’t
any place to wash. She’d be very pretty if her face
was clean, and her hair wasn’t so tangled.”</p>

<p>As the three children paused at the crossing, “the
stolen child” looked up and held out a small dirty
hand.</p>

<p>“Gimme a penny,” she began, in the whining tone
of the professional beggar.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said Dulcie, kindly, “we’d like to
give you some money, but we haven’t any with us.
Would you mind telling us your name?”</p>

<p>“Rosy Finnegan,” answered the crossing-sweeper,
promptly. Dulcie was deeply impressed.</p>

<p>“Rosy is a beautiful name,” she said, “but Finnegan—are
you sure your name really is Finnegan?”</p>

<p>“The stolen child” nodded.</p>

<p>“Me name’s Finnegan,” she said, decidedly.
“Say, ain’t none of yous got a penny?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we haven’t,” Dulcie admitted reluctantly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
“but we’d like to have a little talk with
you. Couldn’t you stop sweeping for a little while?
We’d like to have you come into the park with
us.”</p>

<p>Rosy Finnegan looked very much surprised.
Little girls who lived on Washington Square were
not in the habit of addressing her in such a friendly
manner. But she was of a sociable disposition, and
quite ready for an adventure of any kind. So,
gathering her broom under her arm, she prepared to
follow her new acquaintances.</p>

<p>“Now we can talk better,” said Dulcie, when they
had reached the comparative quiet of the little park.
“I’m afraid it’s too cold to sit down, so we’ll have
to keep walking while we talk. My name is Dulcie
Winslow, and this is my sister Molly. This boy is
Paul Chester, and he’s a sort of cousin of ours. My
sister and I have been interested in you all winter,
and we want to ask you some questions. You say
your first name is Rosy. That’s short for Rose, of
course. I don’t believe many beg—I mean many
little girls like you, are named Rose. It’s quite a
book name.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” said Rosy, looking interested. “I
didn’t never read no books. Me name’s Rosy
Finnegan.”</p>

<p>“You think it’s Finnegan,” said Dulcie, gently,
“but perhaps it’s something else. Do you remember
your mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Sure,” responded Rosy Finnegan, stopping short
in her astonishment; “me mother’s home.”</p>

<p>Dulcie was conscious of a sensation of disappointment
at this reply, but Paul was not so easily
daunted.</p>

<p>“Does she beat you?” he inquired, abruptly.</p>

<p>Rosy grinned.</p>

<p>“I guess she do, sometimes,” she admitted.
Dulcie felt her spirits rising again.</p>

<p>“I hope she isn’t very cruel,” she said, sympathetically.
“Perhaps she isn’t really your own
mother.”</p>

<p>“She’s me mother all right,” persisted Rosy.
“What makes you say she ain’t?”</p>

<p>“Why—why,” faltered Dulcie, finding some difficulty
in explaining, “we don’t know, of course, but
we think perhaps you may have been stolen.”</p>

<p>“The stolen child’s” dirty little face grew suddenly
very red.</p>

<p>“I ain’t stole nothin’,” she declared, indignantly.
“How dare you say I stole!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we didn’t, we didn’t!” protested Dulcie and
Molly both together. “We never thought of such
a thing, did we, Paul?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Paul; “she doesn’t understand.
We don’t think you stole, Rosy, we think
perhaps somebody stole you. People do get stolen
sometimes, at least they do in books, and there was
Charlie Ross.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Yes, that’s it,” chimed in Dulcie. “In books
the stolen children almost always have blue eyes and
golden hair, just like yours. That’s why we thought
you might be one, and we wanted to talk to you
about it. Do you mind if we ask you some questions?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said Rosy, who was beginning
to look very much puzzled, “but I ain’t never stole
nothin’, I can tell you that. A girl on our block
she got took up by the cops for stealin’ apples out of
a cart, but I ain’t never stole a thing, honest I ain’t.”</p>

<p>“We’re quite sure you never did,” soothed
Dulcie. “Stolen children are always very good.
Do you remember anything that happened when you
were very little, almost a baby, you know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can tell you about that,” said Rosy, her
face brightening. “We lived on Rivington Street,
and Dad sold shoe-strings, and Jim and me sold
matches. Jim he sells matches yet, but I don’t.
Ma takes the baby round when she begs. Is that
all ye wants to know, ’cause I ought to be gettin’
back to me crossin’?”</p>

<p>“We’d like to find out a little more, if you don’t
mind,” said Dulcie. “You see, you may have been
stolen before you were old enough to remember, or
perhaps you were very ill, and lost your memory,
like Marjorie in ‘Marjorie’s Quest.’ Were you
ever very ill?”</p>

<p>“I got run over onect,” replied Rosy, not without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
a touch of pride in the recollection. “I was
took to the ’orspittle. It was nice in the ’orspittle;
I liked it.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Dulcie, comprehendingly. “Did
kind ladies bend over you, and speak very gently,
and give you nice things to eat?”</p>

<p>“Sure; them was the nusses. One of ’em was
awful pretty. Jim said he’d like to get run over,
too, so he could go to the ’orspittle. He did try
onect, but the cop catched him, and told him if he
ever done it again, he’d get took up.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?” demanded Paul, who had
no intention of leaving all the glory of finding a
stolen child to Dulcie.</p>

<p>“I dunno jist. Maybe I’m eight, and maybe I’m
nine. Ma says she disremembers.”</p>

<p>“That settles it,” cried Paul, triumphantly. “Of
course she’s been stolen. People always know how
old they are, unless there’s something queer about
them.”</p>

<p>Dulcie’s face brightened. To tell the truth, she
had been growing a little sceptical as to whether
there was, after all, anything particularly “queer”
about Rosy Finnegan. Paul’s conviction revived
her hopes.</p>

<p>“I guess she must be stolen,” she said, “if her
mother doesn’t know how old she is. Rosy, would
you like to find your real family, and go to live in
a beautiful home, where you would have lovely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
clothes to wear, and everybody would love you very
much?”</p>

<p>“Sure I would; I’d like it first rate. When can
I go?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not till you can remember your past. Try
to think very hard, and perhaps your memory will
begin to come back. Don’t you remember any little
prayer or hymn, or—or anything like that? Stolen
children in books generally do.”</p>

<p>“They sings hymns at the mission,” said Rosy.
“I went to the mission onect, but they said I couldn’t
come again if I didn’t wash, so I didn’t go no
more.”</p>

<p>“But—but don’t you like to be clean?” gasped
Dulcie. In her experience, stolen children always
longed for cleanliness, as well as other blessings of
life.</p>

<p>“I hate washin’,” returned Rosy, with so much
sincerity in her tone that it was impossible to doubt
her.</p>

<p>“She’s probably forgotten about taking baths,”
whispered Paul. “She’ll be all right when she’s
found.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how she’s ever going to be found,”
said Dulcie, with a sigh, “if she can’t remember the
least little thing. I’m afraid we’ll have to give
it up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, that’s an awful shame!” cried Paul.
“Maybe she’ll begin to remember in a few minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“Maybe I will,” said Rosy, hopefully. “I want
to go to that nice place, anyhow. Let’s come right
along. It’s cold walkin’ so slow.”</p>

<p>Dulcie clasped her hands in dismay.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do,” she said, tragically.
“We’ve raised her hopes, and we’ll have to disappoint
her. Oh, I wish we hadn’t spoken to her
at all.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we might do,” exclaimed
Molly, with a sudden inspiration. “Get her to take
us home with her, and talk to the person she thinks
is her mother. Maybe she’ll confess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly, we couldn’t. What would Grandma
and Aunt Julia say?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that it matters what they say, if we
are going to help a stolen child find her family,”
said Paul. “They’ll be proud of us afterwards,
especially if we get a big reward. Why, we might
even be talked about in the newspaper.”</p>

<p>But Dulcie was still doubtful.</p>

<p>“I’m sure Grandma would be very angry,” she
protested, “and Aunt Julia, too. Besides, we don’t
know for sure that she ever was stolen. She says
she wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“I guess I made a mistake,” put in Rosy, eagerly.
“I disremembered first, but now I come to think
about it, I’m pretty sure I was stole. Anyhow, I
want the nice clothes. I’ll show you the way to our
tiniment. ’Tain’t far.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Where is it?” inquired Dulcie, still far from
convinced of the wisdom of the proceeding.</p>

<p>“Over on Avenue A.”</p>

<p>“Avenue A,” repeated Dulcie, with a shiver.
“Oh, we’ve never been there in our lives. We can’t
go with her, Paul, we really can’t.”</p>

<p>“All right, you needn’t. I’m going, anyhow, and
so’s Molly. We like to see new places, don’t we,
Molly?”</p>

<p>“I won’t go anywhere without Dulcie,” said
Molly, loyally. “I think we ought to go, though,
Dulcie. She says she really was stolen, and it must
be our duty to help her find her own mother, even
if Grandma and Aunt Julia are angry. I’m sure
Papa would want us to do our duty.”</p>

<p>Dulcie wavered, and Rosy, quick to seize her advantage,
began to cry.</p>

<p>“I want to find me family, I want to find me
family, I do, I do!” she wailed, rubbing her eyes
with her knuckles. “I want to have pretty clothes,
and ice-cream, like in the ’orspittle.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Dulcie’s kind heart.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said desperately, “if you both
think it’s our duty, I suppose we shall have to go.
Are you sure your mother is at home, Rosy?”</p>

<p>Rosy nodded. She had stopped crying as suddenly
as she began, and was evidently quite as much
interested in the adventure as either Molly or
Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Show us the way,” commanded Paul, and three
minutes later, they had left the safe precincts of
Washington Square, and turned their faces resolutely
in the direction of the East River.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>THE HOUSE ON AVENUE A</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THEY were obliged to walk fast, in order to
keep pace with “the stolen child,” who
trotted on ahead, her little yellow head
bobbing up and down in her excitement. For the
first few blocks, all went well, but as the neighborhood
grew more squalid, the streets dirtier and more
crowded, their hearts began to fail.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there were such dirty streets in
New York,” whispered Dulcie. “Don’t you really
think we’d better turn back?”</p>

<p>But, though anything but comfortable himself,
Paul shook his head resolutely.</p>

<p>“If it’s our duty, we ought to go on,” he said.
“I guess it’s always like this where beggars live.
It’s a real adventure, and I never had one before.
I’m going on, even if you don’t. Oh, I say, this is
a pretty awful place. Do you suppose it’s Avenue
A?”</p>

<p>Involuntarily they all paused on the corner, and
at the same moment Rosy turned her head and
asked a question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Can I take Jim along with me?” she demanded,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Along where?” inquired Dulcie.</p>

<p>“To that nice place you said I was goin’ to. I’d
like to take him; he’s me brother.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; perhaps you can,” Dulcie said,
doubtfully. “Isn’t it sweet of her to want to take
her little brother?” she added in a whisper.
“Stolen children always want to do something like
that. Their families are so happy to get them back
they generally let them have anything they want.
Perhaps they’ll let Jim come, and adopt him, and
send him to college, and when they grow up, he and
Rosy will marry each other. It often happens that
way.”</p>

<p>“It’s terribly interesting,” said Molly, “but I
wish Avenue A wasn’t quite so dirty.”</p>

<p>“Is it much farther, Rosy?” Dulcie questioned,
anxiously.</p>

<p>Rosy shook her head, and pointed to a particularly
disreputable-looking building, on the opposite side
of the way.</p>

<p>“It’s there,” she announced; “down in the basement.”</p>

<p>The street was piled with snow and refuse, and
the children were obliged to pick their way, but they
all had rubber boots, and the crossing was effected
without much difficulty. Before the objectionable-looking
tenement Rosy came to a halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“It’s down them steps,” she announced.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to go down there, I really
don’t,” cried Molly, shrinking back in sudden alarm.</p>

<p>Dulcie had grown pale, but her face was stern
and set.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go now we’re here,” she said,
firmly. “I don’t like it, but Paul thinks it’s our
duty. Think of poor little Rosy having to live here
all the time. If we can help her to find her real
family, nothing else will matter.”</p>

<p>But despite her brave words, Dulcie’s heart was
beating very fast, as she followed “the stolen
child” down the slippery flight of steps. Molly
was trembling violently, and even Paul had turned
a little pale. At the foot of the steps Rosy
opened a door, and stood aside to let her companions
enter.</p>

<p>Dulcie and Molly are middle-aged women now,
with boys and girls of their own, but neither of
them has ever forgotten her first impression of that
tenement house basement. It really seemed incredible
that such a quantity of dirt could have accumulated
in so small a space. The floor was dirty, the
walls were dirty, and the few articles of furniture
the room contained were covered with dust. In the
middle of the floor an extremely untidy baby was
sprawling, playing with a half-starved kitten. On a
tumbled-down bed in one corner a man lay, apparently
asleep. There was a small fire in the stove,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
on which a pot was simmering, and a woman in a
soiled calico wrapper had just stooped to add some
ingredient to the steaming contents.</p>

<p>At the opening of the door the woman turned her
head, and at sight of the unexpected visitors she
started back, with an exclamation of astonishment,
and stood staring at the children, with eyes and
mouth wide open. At the same moment the man
on the bed opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Shut that door,” he commanded in a very hoarse
voice, and the words were followed by a severe fit
of coughing.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Rosy. “Dad’s got an awful
cold. He don’t like air.”</p>

<p>The children could not help thinking that a little
fresh air would have improved the atmosphere, but
they dared not say so, and in another moment they
found themselves inside, with the door closed behind
them.</p>

<p>There was a moment of dead silence; then the
woman seemed to find her voice.</p>

<p>“What do yous want?” she inquired in a tone
that was anything but hospitable.</p>

<p>“We want,” began Dulcie, with a mighty effort
to control her shaking voice, “that is, we came with
Rosy. We thought perhaps you wouldn’t mind telling
us some things about her. There seems to be
so much she can’t remember.”</p>

<p>“What’s Rosy been up to?” inquired Mrs. Finnegan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
fixing a stern eye upon her small daughter.
“She ain’t took nothin’ from yous, has she?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no indeed,” cried Dulcie, indignantly.
“I’m sure she’s a very good little girl, but you see,
we’ve been interested in her for a long time, on account
of her blue eyes and golden hair, and this
afternoon we spoke to her. She told us about being
in the hospital, and about your not knowing
just how old she is, and that made us pretty sure
she must have been stolen when she was a baby,
and——”</p>

<p>“Shtolen, is it?” screamed Rosy’s mother, her
eyes beginning to flash ominously, “and who shtole
her, I’d like to be askin’?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—oh, please don’t be angry,”
pleaded Dulcie, involuntarily moving a step nearer
to the closed door. “We didn’t mean you did it,
only—only we thought you might know something
about it, and be able to give us a clue. We want to
find her real mother, you know.”</p>

<p>“What are ye talkin’ about, anyway?” demanded
Mrs. Finnegan, whose temper was evidently not of
the sweetest. “I never heard such crazy talk in
me loife. Nobody shtole my Rosy. I guess it’s
shtealin’ you’ve been yourselves, to get them good
clothes you’ve got on. I’ll be callin’ the cop to yous,
that’s what I’ll be doin’, if yous don’t get out of here
moighty quick.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Molly, and with a shriek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of terror she made for the door. Even Dulcie
quailed before this awful threat, but not so Paul.
His usually pale face had grown suddenly crimson,
and before any one realized his intention, he had
placed himself firmly in front of the angry Mrs.
Finnegan.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t talk in that way,” he said, and his
voice was very loud and clear. “It’s very rude to
insult people in your own house. We’re not the
kind of people who steal. We live on Washington
Square, and we only came here because we
wanted to find out about Rosy. We don’t know
that she was stolen, but we thought she might
have been, and she wanted us to come, didn’t you,
Rosy?”</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Rosy, who had been watching
proceedings with deep interest, opened her lips for
the first time since reaching home.</p>

<p>“They said they’d take me to a nice place, where
I’d have lovely clothes, and ice-cream,” she explained.
“They said I was stole when I was a
baby, and you wasn’t my real mother. Say, Ma,
can I go wid ’em, and Jim too?”</p>

<p>“You cannot,” said Mrs. Finnegan, and there
was unmistakable finality in her tone. “You was
not shtole when you was a baby, and what’s more,
if you ever bring the likes of them in here again,
I’ll wallop you. Now get out, every one of yous,
before I take a shtick to yous. But let me tell you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
one thing first. My Rosy ain’t shtole, and never
was. We’re honest people, we are, and me poor
husband in his bed since Christmas, wid a cough on
him that’s enough to wake the dead. I’ll tell
you——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Finnegan paused abruptly, as the door
opened, and a boy of eleven or twelve appeared on
the threshold.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed the newcomer, staring at
the trembling visitors in astonishment; “what’s
the row?”</p>

<p>“Row,” repeated the woman, “I guess it is a
row. What do you think, Jim? Them young ones
come in here as bold as brass, tellin’ me to me face
our Rosy was shtole when she was a baby. Did ye
ever hear the like of that?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t say she stole her,” put in Paul. “We
only said we thought she might have been stolen.
She said herself perhaps she was.”</p>

<p>“I did not!” shrieked Rosy, in sudden terror, as
her mother made a step in her direction. “It’s lies
he’s tellin’, Ma.”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s lies. Now get along wid yous,
and if I ever see one of yous hangin’ round here,
you’ll get somethin’ you won’t like. Put ’em out,
Jim.”</p>

<p>Jim advanced threateningly.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he ordered. “Out you goes.”</p>

<p>The two little girls, now thoroughly frightened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
made a hasty retreat towards the door, but Paul did
not move.</p>

<p>“Come, Paul,” implored Dulcie, her teeth chattering
with fright. “We don’t want to stay here
any longer. She isn’t a stolen child, after all. Oh,
please do come.”</p>

<p>“I won’t come till she apologizes for being so
rude,” returned Paul, obstinately.</p>

<p>At that moment the man on the bed moved and
raised his head.</p>

<p>“Chase ’em, Jim,” he commanded in his deep,
hoarse voice; “I can’t stand no more talk. The
wind from that door’s enough to give abody a
chill. Chase ’em out, I say, and shut the door.”</p>

<p>“Come along, young one,” said Jim, and seizing
Paul by the shoulders, he gave him a push, which
sent that indignant small boy flying out into the
street. As for Dulcie and Molly, they were already
flying up the steps.</p>

<p>“Let’s run, oh, let’s run,” gasped Molly. “Come,
Dulcie, come, Paul. Oh, do be quick.” And away
flew the terrified child, closely followed by her
sister.</p>

<p>But at the next corner Dulcie’s sense of duty suddenly
asserted itself.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to stop and wait for Paul,” she
panted. “Aunt Julia would be so angry if we left
him behind.”</p>

<p>Molly paused reluctantly, and they both looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
around. The next instant they had each uttered a
shriek of horror, and were running back in the direction
from whence they had come. It was a truly
awful sight which met their gaze, for, rolling on a
pile of snow, were two small figures, kicking and
pummelling each other in a manner which filled
Dulcie and Molly with unspeakable terror, for one
of the figures was Jim Finnegan, and the other was
Paul.</p>

<p>“He’s killing Paul, oh, he’s killing him!” wailed
Molly, wringing her hands. “Somebody stop him;
oh, please do stop him!”</p>

<p>But nobody did stop him, although quite a crowd
of ragged children had gathered to watch the fight.
Possibly street fights were of too common occurrence
in that neighborhood to cause any great excitement.
At any rate, nobody stirred, and an
agonized glance up and down the street convinced
Dulcie that there was not a policeman in sight. It
was quite evident that Paul was getting the worst
of the battle. Jim was at least a year older, and
fully half a head taller, and, moreover, he was accustomed
to fighting. Paul had never fought with
any one before in his life, and had always been considered
a delicate boy. For one moment only did
Dulcie hesitate.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you, Paul,” she shouted, and the terrified
Molly beheld her elder sister suddenly plunge
forward into the snow-drift. In another moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
there were three figures struggling together, instead
of two.</p>

<p>A shout went up from the bystanders.</p>

<p>“Good for the kid. I say, she’s a plucky one.
She’s got the big fellow down. Oh, my eye! she’s
sittin’ on his head.”</p>

<p>“Run, Paul, run,” gasped Dulcie, “quick, before
he gets up again.”</p>

<p>But Paul had no intention of running. His blood
was up.</p>

<p>“I won’t run,” he protested loudly. “I won’t
be pitched out of a house like that. He’s got to
apologize.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come off your high horse,” advised Jim,
who was, after all, a good-natured boy, and having
succeeded, not without difficulty, in removing the
weight on his head, and sending Dulcie rolling over
in the snow, he rose to his feet, grinning. “Get
along home, where you belong, and don’t try to
fight a feller twice your size.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to apol——” began Paul, but he got
no further, for Dulcie had already scrambled to her
feet, and seized him firmly by the arm.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Paul,” she panted. “You’ve
hurt him dreadfully already. See how his nose is
bleeding.”</p>

<p>“So’s mine,” said Paul, putting his hand up to
his face. “Oh, I say, isn’t it awful?” And suddenly
the brave hero began to cry.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>Five minutes later three very subdued, conscience-smitten
children had left Avenue A behind them and
were slowly making their way back in the direction
of Washington Square. Two of the three
were looking decidedly the worse for wear.
Dulcie’s hair-ribbon was gone, and her hat had
lost all semblance of shape, and Paul’s face was
covered with blood, which still continued to pour
from his nose, and one of his eyes was almost
closed.</p>

<p>“Are you suffering very much, Paul?” Molly inquired
anxiously.</p>

<p>“My head aches, and I feel sort of queer all
over,” answered Paul, “but I’m not sorry I did it.
I’d do it right over again if I had to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what will your mother do when she sees
you?” moaned Dulcie, “and I promised to look
after you, too. My goodness! won’t we be punished?”</p>

<p>“I’ll never, never try to help a stolen child find
her family again, not as long as I live,” declared
Molly. “We were only trying to be kind, and do
our duty, and just see what happened.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it would have been different if she’d
really been stolen,” said Dulcie. “I began to be
afraid she wasn’t the minute she said that about
not liking to be clean. We oughtn’t to have gone
home with her, and it was mostly my fault, because
I’m the oldest, but it was so exciting, and I really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
thought we might be able to help her. Take my
handkerchief, Paul, yours is soaking.”</p>

<p>“I say,” observed Paul, accepting the proffered
handkerchief, “couldn’t we go in the basement way?
I don’t want Mother to see me looking like this.”</p>

<p>“We might,” Dulcie admitted. “Bridget’s pretty
good-natured, but there’s your eye. Your mother
will have to see that. And there’s my hat, too.
Grandma will make an awful fuss about it. I really
think the best way will be to go right up-stairs and
tell the whole truth. Papa says it’s always best to
tell the truth and take the consequences.”</p>

<p>Paul made no further suggestions, although the
face behind Dulcie’s handkerchief was very grave
and troubled. He was a tender-hearted boy, and
really loved his mother dearly. The thought of the
horror and distress he was about to cause her was
anything but pleasant. As they neared home, they
were uncomfortably aware of the fact that people
were casting surprised or amused glances at them,
but fortunately they did not meet any one they
knew. At the foot of Mrs. Winslow’s front steps
they all paused.</p>

<p>“You go in first, Molly,” said Dulcie. “You’re
the only one who looks all right. Tell Mary not to
scream when she sees Paul. It might frighten Aunt
Julia, and I think we’d better break it to her gently.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, Molly mounted the steps and rang
the bell, while the other two lingered behind on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
sidewalk. There was a moment of anxious waiting,
and then the front door opened, and on the
threshold stood—not Mary but Grandma herself.
Molly gave a great gasp, and sank against the wall.</p>

<p>“Where—where is Mary?” she faltered, with
shaking lips.</p>

<p>“Gone to the dentist’s. Where are the others?”</p>

<p>Molly did not answer; words were beyond her at
that awful moment, but Mrs. Winslow did not have
to repeat her question, for two forlorn, bedraggled
little figures were already half-way up the steps.
At the sight of them, Grandma started back, with a
cry of horrified astonishment.</p>

<p>“You have all behaved simply outrageously.”
That was Mrs. Winslow’s verdict, when she had
heard the story, which Dulcie, as the eldest of the
party, poured forth without concealment, and with
a strong desire to assume the greater part of responsibility
for the escapade. “You shall all be
severely punished. Dulcie and Molly, go up to your
room, and stay there till I can come to you. Come
with me, Paul, and get your face washed. Your
mother would faint on the spot if she saw you in this
condition. If I had my way, I would give you each
a good whipping, but I believe corporal punishment
is not allowed by your much too-indulgent parents.”
And with a look which expressed unutterable things,
Grandma swept Paul away to the pantry, and the
two little girls went slowly up-stairs to the nursery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Well, did you have a good time in the Square?”
inquired Daisy, looking up from her book at her
sisters’ entrance. “We didn’t go to see Miss Polly,
after all. We listened through the wall, and heard
people talking, so we knew she must have company.
Good gracious! Dulcie, what’s the matter with your
hat?”</p>

<p>Dulcie collapsed into a chair, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>“It’s all ‘the stolen child’s’ fault,” explained
Molly. “She wasn’t stolen, after all, and her
mother was a dreadful person, who was very rude
to us, and her brother and Paul got into a fight,
and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly, how awful!” gasped Daisy. “You
don’t mean Paul really fought?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did, and Dulcie fought too, and sat on
that horrid boy’s head, and made him stop hurting
Paul, and Grandma says we’ve got to be punished.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>MISS POLLY’S PIANO</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“IT’S very humiliating to be in disgrace, and not
allowed to have dinner with your family,”
said Molly, with a long sigh. “I hate bread
and milk, don’t you, Dulcie?”</p>

<p>Dulcie did not answer, but pushed away her almost
untouched bowl, and rested her elbows on the
nursery table. Her face was red and swollen with
crying, and she looked the picture of woe. Molly
regarded her critically.</p>

<p>“You haven’t eaten anything,” she said.
“Aren’t you afraid you’ll be hungry before to-morrow
morning?”</p>

<p>Dulcie shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I am,” she said, drearily. “I can’t
swallow; every time I try something chokes me.”</p>

<p>“Is your throat sore?” Molly inquired, with a
vivid recollection of Maud’s frequent sore throats.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t sore, but there’s a lump in it. Oh,
Molly, it’s awful! I was never so unhappy before
in my life.”</p>

<p>Molly looked very much troubled.</p>

<p>“Is it because Grandma wouldn’t let us go down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
to dinner, and says we’re not to have any dessert for
a week?” she questioned doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind that so much. It’s horrid, of
course, but I could bear it if it wasn’t for other
things. Grandma says I’m a disgrace to the family,
and she’s going to write Papa about it.”</p>

<p>“Papa won’t believe her, I know he won’t,” protested
Molly. “Besides, we can write to him too,
and tell what really happened. I think you were
very brave to fight that boy when he was hurting
Paul.”</p>

<p>“It was a terribly unladylike thing to do,” said
Dulcie. “I don’t wonder Grandma was ashamed.
Young ladies don’t fight street boys, and I’m nearly
twelve. I promised Papa to take care of you all,
and set a good example. And instead of that, I got
you into a horrid scrape, and Paul too.” Suddenly
Dulcie’s head went down on her arms, and she began
to cry.</p>

<p>Molly was at her sister’s side in a moment.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so unhappy, darling, please don’t,” she
pleaded, with her arms round Dulcie’s neck. “It
wasn’t any more your fault than mine and Paul’s.
We really thought we were doing our duty. If
Rosy had been a stolen child, and we’d found her
family, everybody would have been delighted. I
don’t believe even Grandma would have scolded
then.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there are any stolen children in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
the world,” moaned Dulcie. “They’re just in
books, and we were very silly to imagine Rosy must
be one. She wasn’t even very pretty, and she was
so dreadfully dirty. I don’t see why the people
who write books want to put things in that aren’t
true.”</p>

<p>“There was Charlie Ross,” said Molly; “he was
true.”</p>

<p>“He was only one, and there may never have
been another. Anyway, we’ve done something
awful, and I don’t believe Aunt Julia will ever forgive
us for taking Paul to that dreadful place.”</p>

<p>“Here come Daisy and Maud,” exclaimed Molly,
in a tone of relief, as the sound of approaching footsteps
fell upon their ears.</p>

<p>At the entrance of her two sisters, Dulcie lifted
her head.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” she demanded tragically.
“Are you punished, too? It’s only seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Daisy, with a great effort to speak
in her usual cheerful voice. “Aunt Kate is expecting
a missionary, and Grandma said we might as
well get out of the way.”</p>

<p>“There was ice-cream,” announced Maud, “but
Daisy wouldn’t take any. It was good, too, only
Grandma wouldn’t let me have two helpings.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you take any, Daisy?” inquired
Molly, her eyes wide with astonishment.</p>

<p>“Oh, I just thought I wouldn’t,” returned Daisy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
evasively. “It’s nice we could come up so early,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I know what the reason was,” said Dulcie, with
conviction. “It was because we couldn’t have any,
wasn’t it, Daisy?”</p>

<p>Daisy blushed, and looked very much embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Well, I couldn’t enjoy good things to eat when
I knew you had nothing but bread and milk,” she
admitted, at which Molly promptly threw her arms
round her sister’s neck, and hugged her.</p>

<p>“I believe you’re the best girl in the world,
Daisy,” Dulcie declared. “We never should have
gotten into such a scrape if you had been with us.
I knew it wasn’t right all the time, but it was such
an exciting adventure, and we never had a real adventure
in our lives.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I should like an adventure,” said
Maud, virtuously. “Aunt Julia has put Paul to bed,
you know. She’s sure he’s caught some dreadful
disease. She wanted to send for the doctor but
Grandma wouldn’t let her.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a disease is it?” Molly wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure, but I think it’s something called
nerves. That was it, wasn’t it, Daisy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe Paul is going to be ill at
all,” said Daisy, reassuringly. “Grandma doesn’t
think so either. Aunt Kate laughed, and said Paul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
wasn’t the first boy in the family to come home with
a black eye. She was beginning to tell about something
that happened when Papa was a boy, when
Grandma gave that little cough she always gives
when she wants people to stop talking, and Aunt
Kate didn’t say any more.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Papa ever fought with anybody
when he was a boy?” suggested Molly, her
face brightening at the delightful possibility.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but we’ll ask him in our next
letter. Now let’s do something pleasant. It’s a
whole hour till bedtime.”</p>

<p>But for once Daisy’s cheerful suggestion failed to
meet with its usual response. Neither Dulcie nor
Molly felt inclined to do “anything pleasant” that
evening. They tried lotto, but before the first game
was finished Dulcie had begun to cry again.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel like doing anything but going to
bed,” she announced, with a sob. “My heart’s so
heavy, I can’t take an interest in ordinary things.”</p>

<p>“It is pretty dreadful,” agreed Maud. “Aunt
Julia thinks she will have to take Paul back to
Boston. She’s afraid he’ll want to go on playing
with us, and she says we aren’t fit to associate with
him. I don’t think it’s quite fair to say all of us,
when Daisy and I didn’t do a single thing. I wish
Miss Polly would sing; it’s always comforting to
hear music when you’re sad.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see Miss Polly,” exclaimed Daisy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
with a sudden inspiration. “I haven’t heard the
piano all day. Perhaps she isn’t well.”</p>

<p>Dulcie shook her head.</p>

<p>“I can’t go,” she said, mournfully. “I’ve cried
so much my head aches, and my eyes are all
swollen.”</p>

<p>“So are mine,” added Molly, “and I don’t feel
like making calls any more than Dulcie does. You
and Maud might go, though.”</p>

<p>“You go, Daisy,” coaxed Maud. “I don’t like
that dark closet at night. Ask her please to sing
‘Only an Armor-Bearer,’ or ‘Pull For the Shore.’”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Daisy, good-naturedly, and after
giving the afflicted Dulcie a sympathetic kiss on the
back of her bowed head, she tripped away cheerfully
on her errand.</p>

<p>The children had become quite accustomed to
visiting their neighbor by this time, and the mysterious
door in the wall had lost some of its original
fascination. Still, there was always a certain thrill
of excitement in turning the handle, and the sudden
plunge into the housemaid’s closet next door.
Daisy’s heart beat rather fast, as she groped her way
amid brooms and dust-pans, and stepped out into
the lighted hall. Outside Miss Polly’s door she
paused for a moment, to make sure the little cripple
was alone. Once they had heard voices, and had
crept quietly away again, for if the landlady, or
any one else in the boarding-house, were to discover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
their secret, who knew what might happen?
It was possible that Miss Collins might have as
strong an objection to an unlocked door between the
houses as Grandma herself. But to-night all was
quiet, and after a moment’s hesitation, Daisy
knocked softly.</p>

<p>Instead of the usual sound of the wheel-chair being
pushed across the room, a rather unsteady voice
called, “Come in.”</p>

<p>“Good evening, Miss Polly,” said the visitor,
cheerfully, as she stepped over the threshold, and
closed the door, “I came to ask—why, Miss Polly,
what’s the matter? Are you ill?”</p>

<p>Miss Polly was not in the wheel-chair; she was in
bed, and the face she turned to greet the little girl
was very white. But at Daisy’s anxious question,
she tried to smile her old bright smile.</p>

<p>“No, no, dear, not ill, only a little tired. I asked
Maggie to help me to bed before she went out for
the evening. Come and sit down. I am glad to
have company, but where are the others?”</p>

<p>“They couldn’t come very well this evening,”
said Daisy, blushing. “I can’t stay long either; I
only came to ask if you would sing something, but
of course you can’t now you’re in bed. Why, Miss
Polly, where’s the piano?”</p>

<p>“It’s gone, dearie,” answered Miss Polly, in the
same low, unsteady voice in which she had called
“come in.” “It went away this afternoon. I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
very sorry, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to sing to
you any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Polly,” cried Daisy, and stopped short
in sudden embarrassment, for her friend’s cheeks,
which had been so pale a moment before, had
flushed a dusky crimson, and there was such a sad
look in her eyes that the little girl could not
think of another word to say. But Miss Polly
was not slow to read the sympathy in her visitor’s
face.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so distressed,” she said, kindly.
“Come here and sit on the bed, and I’ll tell you
about it. It was hard, of course, but we all have
hard things to bear sometimes, and I ought to be
thankful that I was able to keep my dear piano so
long.”</p>

<p>“Was it the gentleman in the back room who objected?”
asked Daisy, as she took the proffered seat
on the bed, and slipped her hand into Miss Polly’s.</p>

<p>Miss Polly gave the kind little hand an affectionate
squeeze.</p>

<p>“No, dear, nobody objected, every one was very
kind. Miss Collins even tried to persuade me to
keep it a little longer, but I couldn’t do that, after I
understood about the money.”</p>

<p>“What money?” inquired Daisy, with deep interest.</p>

<p>“My money, dear. It isn’t all gone, I am thankful
to say, but the bank in Vermont, where I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
had several hundred dollars, failed the other day,
and my lawyer has written me that I have been
spending more than I realized these past three years.
Of course I couldn’t run into debt, so the wisest plan
seemed to be to sell——”</p>

<p>Miss Polly paused abruptly, and put up her hand
to shade her eyes.</p>

<p>“You mean to sell the piano?” whispered Daisy,
winking hard to keep back the sympathetic tears.
“Oh, Miss Polly, and you loved it so.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence, then Miss Polly spoke,
and though her voice was not as bright as usual, it
no longer trembled.</p>

<p>“It seems a little hard just at first,” she said, with
a faint smile, “but I shall get used to it in time, as
I had to other things, that were even harder. It’s
wonderful to find how kind and sympathetic people
are. Why, would you believe it, my dear, that foolish
Maggie actually cried when she was putting me
to bed. I used to think her a little indifferent sometimes,
but I see I was mistaken. My piano was a
great pleasure, but I still have my books, and my
dear little neighbors too. I shouldn’t like to have
Tom hear of it, it would grieve him so much, but
there isn’t any need of his ever knowing.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t have let it happen if he had
known,” cried Daisy. “Oh, dear Miss Polly, won’t
you please write him about it? He’d be so unhappy
if he ever found out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>Daisy’s voice was pleading, but Miss Polly shook
her head resolutely.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she said, gently, “you don’t understand.
Some day Tom must know, of course, but
not till things are a little easier for him. Miss
Collins has been trying to persuade me to write, but
I know better. I had a letter from Tom this morning;
such a dear letter; I will read it to you.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, Miss Polly drew from under her
pillow a crumpled sheet of paper, covered with a
firm, manly handwriting.</p>

<p>“I think I could almost repeat it by heart,” she
said, smoothing out the letter with loving fingers.
“I keep all his letters, and read them over and over.
This one isn’t very long, but the dear boy is so busy.
It’s very good of him to take the time to write at all.
Would you like to hear what he says?”</p>

<p>Daisy said she would like it very much, and Miss
Polly began to read in a voice that was still a little
unsteady.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear old Polly</span>:</p>

<p>“Your good letter reached us several days
ago, and would have been answered sooner but for
the fact that I have been working every evening this
week, and some nights haven’t left the office till
after nine. It’s a bit hard on that little wife of
mine, but I tell her all is grist that comes to our
mill, and if things keep on as they have for the past
year, it won’t be very long before I can begin to let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
up a little. Who knows but that we may have our
carriage, and our box at the opera, some fine day.
Helen laughs when I predict a glorious future, but,
joking aside, I have good reason to expect another
raise of salary in the spring. My employer, Mr.
Anderson, gave me a strong hint to that effect a few
days ago.</p>

<p>“We laughed heartily over your description of
your interesting little neighbors, who have discovered
a secret door in the wall. Rather an unusual
find in a New York boarding-house, I should
think. It reminds me of some of those thrilling
tales we used to read in our childhood. I shall expect
to hear next of a secret staircase leading to a
dungeon, where a captive princess is kept in concealment.
I am glad you find the children so entertaining,
but I should think you might be rather tired
when evening comes, and prefer some other amusement
to singing ballads. However, that is your
affair, not mine. All I care about is that you don’t
work too hard, and wear yourself out. You and
Helen will have some fine times over your music,
when you make us that long deferred visit, for she
is as fond of singing as you are, and I really think
you will be pleased with her voice. We have hired
a piano, and I generally find her singing away like a
nightingale when I come home late of an evening.
She says she can’t help it; it’s the way she has of
expressing her happiness. As to your namesake, if
she doesn’t sing yet, she certainly crows. She is as
jolly and healthy as a baby can be, and Helen warns
me not to forget to give you the great news, little
Polly has cut her first tooth.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear little sister, I must ask you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
pardon a short letter, for it is after eleven <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> and
Helen is beginning to look severe, as she invariably
does when she considers I am not getting my proper
allowance of sleep. I am delighted to hear that you
are enjoying your piano so much. Have you been
to any good concerts lately? How about the season
ticket for the opera I requested you to buy, with
that small Christmas check? Helen and I indulged
in a little dissipation one night last week. She met
me in town, and we dined at a restaurant, and went
to the theatre. It was a great treat, I assure you,
and as ‘our one and only maid’ seems a capable sort
of person, Helen was not afraid to leave baby in her
care.</p>

<p>“Good-night, old girl. Write often, and believe
me, as always,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your affectionate brother,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Tom Oliver</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Isn’t it a dear, kind letter?” said Miss Polly,
looking up with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s very nice indeed,” agreed Daisy, “but, dear
Miss Polly, I can’t help wishing he knew about
everything.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, no, dear,” she said, resolutely, “not just
yet. Tom and Helen must have a little more time
to themselves, and then—well, perhaps in another
year. But don’t let us talk any more about my tiresome
affairs. Tell me what you have all been doing
since you came to see me last.”</p>

<p>“How long you stayed, Daisy, and Miss Polly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
never sang a single song,” reproached Maud, when
her sister returned to the nursery, at a quarter past
eight.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t come back any sooner,” explained
Daisy. “Miss Polly is very unhappy, and I think
it comforted her a little to have me stay and talk.
I told her all about this afternoon, and she laughed,
she really did, Dulcie, and said she wished she could
have seen you and Paul fighting that big boy. It
was the only time she laughed, for, oh, girls, such
a very sad thing has happened. Poor Miss Polly
has lost a great deal of money, and she’s had to sell
her piano.”</p>

<p>“I think the world is a very sad place,” remarked
Dulcie, with a long sigh, when they had heard all
that Daisy could tell them of Miss Polly’s troubles.
“It’s been a very uncomfortable day, for everybody.
Now let’s go to bed, and I’ll talk to you about
Mamma.”</p>

<p>It was nearly half-past nine, and Dulcie’s voice
had begun to sound decidedly drowsy, when they
were all startled into wakefulness by a knock at the
nursery door.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” demanded Daisy, sitting up in bed.</p>

<p>“It’s me—I, I mean,” answered a familiar voice.
“I can’t stay but a minute, for fear of Mother, but
I heard the missionary man talking as if he was
preaching a sermon, so I’m sure he can’t be going
quite yet. I just wanted to tell Dulcie and Molly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
I’m not a bit sick, and I don’t believe I’m going to
be. Mother always fusses a lot, but she doesn’t
mean it all, and I’m going to write to Father to-morrow,
and tell him how plucky Dulcie was.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>DULCIE’S BIRTHDAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PAUL was correct in his prediction; he was not
ill the next day, nor did he manifest any signs
of approaching illness during the following
week. His mother was very much surprised. Her
sister Kate remarked sarcastically that she believed
Julia was disappointed that none of her prognostications
of evil came to pass, but when the ninth day
was passed, even Mrs. Chester was forced to confess
that for once in his life her boy had escaped
unharmed. For the first day or two she kept Paul
constantly with her, and he and the little girls met
only at meals, but as time went on, this strict discipline
began to relax, and by the end of the week
the children were allowed to play together again.
Grandma and Aunt Kate were very busy attending
a series of missionary meetings, and had little time
or thought to devote to anything else. Otherwise
the children’s punishment might have been more
prolonged. Paul’s father had written a letter to
his wife, after reading which Mrs. Chester had
talked long and seriously to her little boy, and had
secured a solemn promise from that small delinquent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
to refrain from any further mischief. Paul
was a truthful boy, and when he had once made a
promise his mother knew she could trust him to
keep it.</p>

<p>“But never, never again shall I allow Paul to go
out with those children,” Mrs. Chester declared to
her mother and sister. “Goodness only knows what
mischief they might lead the dear child into.”</p>

<p>“They may get into plenty of mischief,” returned
Grandma, with her grim smile, “but I will engage
there won’t be any more attempts to find a stolen
child.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Winslow was correct. The very words
“stolen child” were sufficient to cause Dulcie’s
cheeks to burn with mortification, and bring the
tears of humiliation to Molly’s eyes.</p>

<p>But children cannot go on thinking of unpleasant
things for very long at a time, and by the end of the
second week the events of that dreadful afternoon
had ceased to be the foremost thought in any of
their minds.</p>

<p>“You and Dulcie must stay down-stairs this evening,”
Molly informed Paul, one afternoon just before
dinner. “Daisy and Maud and I are going to
be very busy.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to be busy about?” Paul
inquired, with pardonable curiosity. He rather enjoyed
the evenings in the nursery, with the little
girls, for since the arrival of the Chesters, Grandma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
had not insisted on their remaining in the dining-room
after dinner.</p>

<p>“To-morrow is Dulcie’s birthday,” explained
Molly, “and we’ve got to do up the presents this
evening.”</p>

<p>Paul looked interested.</p>

<p>“What presents is she going to have?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Molly, not without some embarrassment,
“you see, it isn’t very easy to arrange. If
we had some money, we’d buy presents, of course,
but we haven’t any of us got a penny. Papa sent
us each five dollars for Christmas, but Grandma put
it in the bank for us, and we can’t get it out again
till we’re of age, and that won’t be for ever so many
years. So we have to give something we have already.
Daisy made a book-mark, but we couldn’t
all do that, because Dulcie only reads one book at a
time. Daisy and I both wanted to give her our
Sunday hats, because hers got spotted in the rain,
but we were afraid Grandma wouldn’t let us. I’m
giving her some of my hair-ribbons; they’re not new,
but they’re quite good yet, and Dulcie loves hair-ribbons.
Maud wanted to give some of her paper
dolls, but we think twelve is too old for dolls, so
she’s decided to give her gold locket that Papa
gave her before he went away. It’s very pretty,
and there is some of Mamma’s hair in it. We’re
going to tie the parcels up to-night, and write messages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
on them. Daisy does the writing, and we say
things like ‘For Dulcie, from her loving sister
Molly,’ or ‘With loving birthday wishes, from
Maud.’ It’s really quite exciting doing up the
presents.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think it would be much fun, when
you haven’t anything to do up but your own old
things,” objected Paul. “What are Grandma and
Aunt Kate going to give?”</p>

<p>“Grandma and Aunt Kate!” repeated Molly, in
astonishment, “why, they never give presents except
on Christmas, and then Grandma only gave us
some woolen stockings, and Aunt Kate gave us each
a cake of scented soap. Grandma says nobody ever
gave her a birthday present in her life.”</p>

<p>“I got a lot of things on my birthday,” said Paul.
“Father gave me a velocipede, and Mother a lot of
books, and—I say, I’d like to give Dulcie a present,
too. Father gave me five dollars to spend in New
York. What do you think she’d like?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Paul, how kind you are!” cried Molly, her
face beaming with pleasure. “I know a book she
wants dreadfully, and she never can get it at the
library, because it’s always out. It’s ‘Little Men,’
by Miss Alcott. We’ve all read ‘Little Women,’
and we loved it, but ‘Little Men’ has been out every
time Dulcie asked for it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Paul, grandly, “she shall have
it. I’ll get Mother to take me to a bookstore to-morrow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
Do you always give each other your old
things for birthday presents?”</p>

<p>“Yes, at least we have since Papa went away.
Daisy’s birthday comes in May, and mine is in July.
I suppose Dulcie will give the locket to Daisy, because
it’s about the nicest thing we’ve got, and perhaps—I
don’t know, of course—but Daisy may give
it to me when my birthday comes. Maud’s birthday
isn’t till September, and by that time I can give
it back to her again.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the queerest way of giving presents
that I ever heard of,” declared Paul. “I shouldn’t
like it one bit, but I suppose you don’t mind so much
if you’re used to it.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any use minding what you can’t
help,” said Molly, philosophically, and just then the
dinner-bell rang, and the conversation came to an end.</p>

<p>Immediately after dinner the three younger girls
left the dining-room, and Dulcie, looking quite happy
and excited, sat down to spend a silent evening with
her elders. Paul would have liked to follow the
others, but was too proud to go where he had not
been invited, so having nothing better to do, he consented
with unusually good grace to his mother’s
proposal that he should read a chapter or two of
ancient history.</p>

<p>“To-morrow is your birthday, isn’t it?” Paul
observed to Dulcie, as the two children went up-stairs
together, at eight o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Yes,” said Dulcie, smiling; “that’s why the
others went up so early; they wanted to tie up the
presents.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea what you’re going to get?”
Paul asked, curiously.</p>

<p>“Not the very least, and it’s so exciting wondering
about it.” And Dulcie laughed, such a happy
laugh, that Paul gazed at her in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“I hope she won’t be disappointed,” he said to
himself. “I wish I’d known about that book before,
so I could have bought it in time. I should be
disappointed enough if I didn’t get anything but old
junk for my birthday, and I guess most people
would, too.”</p>

<p>But when Dulcie came down to breakfast the next
morning, she did not look in the least disappointed.
She was wearing a pink hair-ribbon, which Paul remembered
to have noticed as a favorite color with
Molly, and round her neck, attached to a piece of
black velvet, was a tiny gold locket.</p>

<p>“Happy birthday,” remarked Paul, as Dulcie
slipped into her seat at the table. “Did you like
your presents?”</p>

<p>“I loved them,” answered Dulcie, heartily. “I
woke up before six, and took all the packages into
bed; I was so crazy to see what they were.”</p>

<p>At that moment Grandma looked up from the
morning paper, to inquire sharply:</p>

<p>“What’s that round your neck, Dulcie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“It’s my locket,” said Dulcie, proudly, touching
the trinket with loving fingers. “It was Maud’s,
but she gave it to me for a birthday present. Papa
gave it to her, and there’s a piece of Mamma’s hair
in it.”</p>

<p>“Take it off the moment you go up-stairs,” commanded
Mrs. Winslow. “Children don’t wear
jewelry in the morning. I am surprised you didn’t
know better than to put it on.”</p>

<p>Dulcie’s face fell, and she grew suddenly scarlet,
but she said nothing, and no further allusions were
made on the subject of birthdays.</p>

<p>The morning was taken up with lessons, as usual,
and after luncheon the four little girls were sent
out for their daily exercise in the Square. They
were not allowed to go far from home by themselves,
and as it was a cold, dark afternoon, with a
strong wind blowing, they did not find the solemn
walk round and round the Square particularly
enjoyable. Dulcie left the others for a few
minutes, while she made a call at the circulating
library, whence she returned looking rather crestfallen.</p>

<p>“Did you get it this time?” Daisy inquired,
eagerly.</p>

<p>Dulcie shook her head.</p>

<p>“Out as usual,” she said. “I got ‘Heartsease,’
by Charlotte Yonge, but I don believe it’s half as
nice as ‘Little Men.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Molly heard both question and answer, and looked
suddenly pleased and mysterious.</p>

<p>Paul had gone out with his mother, but on his
return, at about four o’clock, he ran up-stairs to the
nursery, two steps at a time. He was carrying a
parcel under his arm. He found his four friends
already returned from their walk, and somewhat to
his surprise, three of them—including Dulcie herself—did
not look very much pleased to see him.</p>

<p>“What are you all doing?” he inquired, with
some curiosity, for it was evident that his entrance
had interrupted something.</p>

<p>“Oh, just playing,” answered Daisy, blushing,
and Dulcie added hastily: “It’s a very silly game;
you wouldn’t care about it.”</p>

<p>“How do you know I wouldn’t?” demanded the
visitor, who was standing in the doorway, with one
hand behind him.</p>

<p>“Because I know you wouldn’t; it isn’t a boy’s
game at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think you might tell me what it is, anyway,”
said Paul, rather offended, and Molly, who
had noticed the parcel in her friend’s hand, hastened
to say soothingly:</p>

<p>“There isn’t any harm in telling him; I don’t believe
he’ll laugh. We’re having a make-believe
party, Paul.”</p>

<p>“What’s a make-believe party?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see,” Daisy explained, “this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
Dulcie’s birthday, and we wanted to do something a
little different from ordinary days. Of course
Grandma wouldn’t let us have a real party, so we’re
having an imaginary one, and all the people who
come to it are make-believes.”</p>

<p>Paul laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s the funniest party I ever heard of,” he
said. “I say, let me play, too.”</p>

<p>Dulcie and Daisy looked doubtful, but Molly
pleaded, and in the end the others consented, after
exacting a promise from Paul not to laugh, and
never to let the grown-ups know how silly they had
been.</p>

<p>“We pretend this is the parlor,” said Molly.
“We are all dressed in party dresses. Mine is pink
silk, with white dotted muslin over it. There’s an
imaginary piano over there by the window, and a
man is playing dance music on it. Dulcie stands
here by the door, and shakes hands with people when
they come in. I announce their names, and everybody
brings her a present. I’ll show you how we
do it.” And, turning her head in the direction of
the open door, Molly announced in a good imitation
of “Grandma’s company voice”:</p>

<p>“Miss Blanche Bud.”</p>

<p>Dulcie advanced and held out her hand.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to see you, Blanche,” she said.
“It was lovely of you to come to my party. Your
dress is very pretty. Oh, are these flowers for me?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
How very sweet of you to bring them. Maud,
please put these roses in water.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it fun?” giggled Maud, seizing the imaginary
bouquet from her sister’s outstretched hand.
“If I shut my eyes tight, and pretend very hard, I
can almost make myself believe it’s a real party.”</p>

<p>Paul was finding some difficulty in keeping his
promise not to laugh.</p>

<p>“Let me come next,” he urged, and Molly, with
another glance at the mysterious package in Paul’s
hand, announced:</p>

<p>“Master Paul Chester.”</p>

<p>“How do you do, Paul?” said Dulcie, gravely.
“I’m glad you could come. It’s rather a cloudy
day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Many happy returns of the day, and here’s a
present for you,” said Paul, thrusting his parcel into
Dulcie’s hand, and instantly retreating to the background.</p>

<p>“Why—why, it’s a real present!” cried Dulcie,
quite forgetting the make-believe party in her surprise.</p>

<p>“Let me help untie the string,” pleaded Maud.
“I love to open parcels. Oh, it’s a book. Dulcie
likes books better than most any other presents,
Paul.”</p>

<p>“It’s ‘Little Men,’” said Dulcie, with shining
eyes; “the book I’ve been wanting for so long!
How did you know I wanted it, Paul?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Molly told me,” said Paul, who was feeling
much gratified at the excitement produced by his
gift. “I bought it this afternoon when I was out
with Mother. She said I ought to write something
in it, but there wasn’t time. I’ll write it now.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Dulcie, hugging her new treasure
tight. “Oh, Paul, I do thank you so much.
What would you like to write?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Paul, reflectively, “Mother thought
something French would be nice, but I hate French.
I think ‘From Paul Chester to his affectionate
friend Dulcie Winslow’ would be all right, don’t
you? Or would you rather have some poetry? I
know a lot of poetry.”</p>

<p>Dulcie said she liked Paul’s first suggestion best,
and the little boy sat down at the desk to write the
inscription.</p>

<p>“It’s the first really nice birthday present you’ve
had, Dulcie,” said Daisy, joyfully; “I’m so glad you
got it.”</p>

<p>“They were all nice,” declared Dulcie, giving her
sister an affectionate squeeze. “I loved every single
one. I’m awfully glad to have ‘Little Men,’ though.
I’ll read it out loud this evening, if you like. Have
you finished, Paul? Oh, how beautifully you
write.”</p>

<p>Paul looked pleased.</p>

<p>“I like buying presents for people,” he said,
grandly. “Mother said she was glad I was generous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
but she didn’t think I need spend so much
money. I told her I wanted to, because I liked
Dulcie, and I thought it was real mean nobody gave
her anything new for her birthday.”</p>

<p>“What did your mother say?” Dulcie asked, with
pardonable curiosity.</p>

<p>“Oh, she said Grandma had a pretty hard time
keeping you all here, and we mustn’t expect too
much of her. Now let’s go on with that party.
What do you do about things to eat?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they’ll have to be imaginary, like all
the rest of it,” said Dulcie, laughing. “Grandma
won’t let us bring food up here, and we’re not allowed
to eat between meals, anyway. Why, here
comes Mary. What is it, Mary? Does Grandma
want us?”</p>

<p>“It’s a package for you, Miss Dulcie,” said Mary,
rather breathless from the four long flights of stairs.
“It came by express, and I thought you might like
to have it right away. Mrs. Winslow’s out, and
Miss Kate, too.”</p>

<p>“Why, what in the world can it be?” cried
Dulcie, and all the others gathered about her eagerly,
as she untied the string.</p>

<p>“It’s a wooden box,” announced Molly.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a birthday present from Papa,” suggested
Maud.</p>

<p>“Or from Lizzie,” added Daisy.</p>

<p>“It’s from California,” said Paul; “I see California<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
on the back. Do you know anybody
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Uncle Stephen and Miss Leslie,” said
Dulcie; “it must be from one of them, but how did
they know this was my birthday?”</p>

<p>“There’s a letter inside,” cried Molly. “Let’s
read it before we open the box, then we’ll know
who sent it.”</p>

<p>“Why not see what’s in the box first?” objected
Paul, who was almost as much interested in the contents
of the mysterious package as the little girls
themselves.</p>

<p>“Because,” said Daisy, “it’s so exciting to anticipate,
and as soon as we know what’s inside the
box the excitement will be over. Do read the letter
first, Dulcie.”</p>

<p>“It might be only soap, you know,” suggested
Maud, with a recollection of Aunt Kate’s Christmas
present.</p>

<p>“The letter is from Miss Leslie,” cried Dulcie,
who, obedient to Daisy’s request, had already torn
open the envelope. “Oh, isn’t it lovely? Listen to
what she says.” And she read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Dulcie</span>:</p>

<p>“I was going to say ‘little Dulcie,’ but remembered
just in time that people of twelve don’t
like to be considered ‘little’ any longer, and if I
am not mistaken, you are going to have a birthday
on the twentieth. Now I suppose you are wondering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
what little bird brought me that interesting piece
of news, and I am not going to tell you, because it
is fun to keep guessing. I am sending a box of our
preserved California fruit, which I hope may reach
you on the right day.</p>

<p>“I was delighted with your nice letter, and very
much interested in the brave little invalid next door.
I agree with you that her brother ought to know of
her condition, but if she will persist in being so unselfish
and heroic, I don’t see that her friends can
do anything to help matters. I am glad you go to
see her often, and as to the door in the wall——”</p>
</div>

<p>Dulcie came to a sudden startled pause. All the
little girls had grown very much embarrassed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Why don’t you go on?”
demanded Paul, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” said Dulcie, “it’s a secret. I ought to
have stopped before, but I didn’t notice.”</p>

<p>Paul looked disappointed and a little offended.</p>

<p>“I can keep secrets just as well as anybody else,”
he said, sulkily, “but of course if you don’t want me
to hear, I won’t listen.” And he turned to leave
the room, with an air of injured dignity.</p>

<p>It was an awkward moment. Nobody wanted to
offend Paul, especially after his generosity in giving
Dulcie a birthday present. And yet, could he be
trusted with this precious secret? It was Daisy who
finally settled the difficulty.</p>

<p>“I believe we can trust Paul,” she said, with
sudden decision. “I’m sure a nice boy can keep a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
promise. Finish the letter first, Dulcie, and then
let’s tell him all about Miss Polly.”</p>

<p>So Dulcie, after making sure that Mary had gone
down-stairs again, and impressing upon Paul that
what he was about to hear was “a very solemn
secret indeed,” went on with her letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As to the door in the wall,” Miss Leslie wrote,
“it is certainly very interesting and romantic. I
don’t think I ought to advise you to keep a secret
from your grandmother, but, as you say the door
has been unfastened for years, and no one has ever
discovered the fact before, it doesn’t seem as if there
could be much harm in keeping the secret a little
longer. I am glad you have written your father
about it, however, for his advice in the matter will
be much better than mine.</p>

<p>“Mamma and I have been very busy since our
return from the East, or I would have written
sooner. California is very beautiful just now. I
wish you could see the roses in our garden, and hear
the mocking-birds sing. There is a nest right outside
my window. I would love to have you all out
here for a visit, but am afraid your grandmother
would never consent to your taking such a long
journey. We were six days on the train, but
Mamma and I rather enjoyed it. I have seen your
uncle several times since our return. He is very
well, and busy, as we all are.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear little girl, I must say good-bye
for to-day. Write soon again and tell me all you
do, for I am interested in everything that concerns
my little friends. Give a great deal of love to
Daisy, Molly, and Maud, and with an equal share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
for yourself, and best wishes for a very happy
birthday, believe me,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your sincere friend,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Florence Leslie</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“What a beautiful letter!” exclaimed Daisy.
“How do you suppose she found out about your
birthday?”</p>

<p>“I suppose Uncle Stephen must have told her,
but I didn’t think he knew. It was dear of her to
write, and to send such a wonderful present.”</p>

<p>“I’ve looked inside the box,” Maud informed
them, “and it’s full of big sticky, delicious-looking
things. May I taste one right away, Dulcie?”</p>

<p>“Of course you may. We’ll all have some. Oh,
I do wish Uncle Stephen would hurry up and marry
Miss Leslie. It would be so nice to have her for
an aunt.”</p>

<p>“Hurry and tell about that door in the wall,”
put in Paul, a little impatiently. “I’ve promised I
won’t tell anybody, and I don’t see why you want to
keep me waiting any longer.”</p>

<p>“We won’t,” said Dulcie, and while they all
munched the delicious candied fruit, they told him
the story of brave little Miss Polly.</p>

<p>“We miss the piano very much,” said Maud,
when the story was finished, and Paul was looking
as deeply interested as could possibly be expected.
“It used to be so nice to hear Miss Polly singing
when we were going to sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“I’m afraid Miss Polly misses it very much, too,”
said Daisy, sadly. “She doesn’t say anything about
it, but her eyes have such a sorrowful look in them,
and she doesn’t laugh nearly as often as she did
before.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go and see her,” said Paul. “I’ll
sing to her if she wants me to.”</p>

<p>“Why, Paul, we didn’t know you could sing,”
cried Dulcie, in surprise. “We never heard you.”</p>

<p>Paul blushed.</p>

<p>“I hate doing it generally,” he confessed.
“Mother makes me sometimes, to show off, you
know, and I’m going to be in the choir next year.
I don’t mind singing for that lady if you think she’d
like to have me. I know some French songs, and
‘The Holy City,’ and ’most all the songs in ‘Pinafore.’
I can say a lot of poetry, too.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go to see Miss Polly right away, and take
Paul with us,” urged Molly, eagerly. “It will be
much more fun than having a make-believe party,
won’t it, Dulcie? And we can take her some of this
lovely fruit. We’ve been wanting to give her a
present ever since the first time we went, but we
never had anything to take before.”</p>

<small>PAUL ENTERTAINS MISS POLLY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MISS POLLY was in her wheel-chair,
which she had drawn as close as possible
to the register, for the day was cold, and
only a small amount of furnace heat reached the top
floor. She had evidently been reading, but the book
had fallen into her lap, and lay there neglected, while
the little cripple gazed straight before her, with a
sad, far-away look in her eyes. Miss Polly was certainly
thinner and paler than on that Sunday when
Molly had made her first visit, but when, at the
sound of a knock at her door, she turned to greet
her little neighbors, her smile was as bright and her
voice as cheerful as ever.</p>

<p>“My dear children,” she cried joyfully, “how
glad I am to see you. And you’ve brought your
visitor, too. How do you do, Paul? You see I
know your name. These little friends of mine have
told me a great deal about you. It was kind of
you to come to see me.”</p>

<p>Paul stepped forward and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“I’ll sing for you if you’d like to have me,” he
announced abruptly. “I don’t like doing it generally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
but I don’t mind this time. Dulcie says you
like music.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly beamed.</p>

<p>“I do indeed,” she said, heartily. “I should love
to hear you sing. It was dear of you to think of
offering.”</p>

<p>“Do you like hand-organs?” inquired Paul,
gravely. “There was a very nice one playing in
front of our house this morning. It played six
tunes, and there was a monkey. I threw out five
cents, and the monkey took off his hat. If you give
an organ-man five cents, he’ll generally play for
quite a long time.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly smiled, and said that hand-organs
were sometimes rather pleasant, and then Dulcie—who
had been eagerly awaiting her turn to speak—came
forward with her offering.</p>

<p>“We’ve brought you a present,” she said. “It’s
some candied fruit that Miss Leslie sent us all the
way from California, and it’s delicious. We wanted
you to have some, but I’m sorry we hadn’t a nicer
box to put it in.”</p>

<p>“It’s really Dulcie’s present,” put in Daisy.
“Miss Leslie sent it for her birthday, so we ought
not to be thanked. We all wanted to bring you a
present, but this is the first time we ever had anything
we thought you would enjoy.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly was warm in her thanks, and at
Maud’s request, consented to try a candied apricot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
which she pronounced to be delicious. Then she
asked some questions about the birthday, and was
told the story of the family presents and “the make-believe
party.”</p>

<p>“Make-believe things are really quite good fun
sometimes, when you can’t have real ones,” remarked
Daisy, cheerfully, when the story—to which
Miss Polly had listened with much interest—was
finished. “Once Aunt Kate wanted our old dolls
to put in a missionary box, and we thought it would
be selfish not to let the poor little missionary children
have them. We missed them very much at first,
but then we played we had a whole family of imaginary
children, that nobody could see but ourselves,
and it was so interesting we forgot all about
the dolls. It was very nice afterwards, for the missionary’s
little girl wrote us a letter, and told us how
much she and her sister were enjoying our dolls.
She described the log-house where they live, away
out West, where the Indians are, and it was so interesting.
We’ve got the letter still. Would you
like to see it?”</p>

<p>Miss Polly said she would like it very much, and
then, noticing signs of impatience on Paul’s part,
she asked him if he would like to begin to sing.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the small boy, promptly. “I
guess I’ll sing ‘The Holy City’ first. You might
not understand the French songs.” And without
further hesitation, he began to sing in a voice so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
clear and true that the little girls gazed at him in
speechless surprise and admiration.</p>

<p>There were actually tears in Miss Polly’s eyes
when the song ended, and her “Oh, my dear, that
was a treat!” sounded so genuine that Paul’s bosom
swelled with pride.</p>

<p>“I’ll sing ‘<i>Au Claire De La Lune</i>’ next,” he said,
condescendingly, “and if you don’t understand
French, I’ll translate it into English.”</p>

<p>It appeared, however, that Miss Polly did understand
French, and perhaps the next half-hour was
the most enjoyable the invalid had spent since the
day when her beloved piano was taken away. Paul
sang song after song, some in English, others in
French, some sad, some gay; ending with several
selections from “Pinafore,” the charming operetta,
which had taken the world by storm a year before.</p>

<p>“You have given me more pleasure than I can
express,” Miss Polly said, when they had all stopped
laughing over “The Ruler of the Queen’s Navee,”
and Paul had been forced to admit that his throat
was getting tired. “You have a beautiful voice,
my boy; your mother must be very proud of
you.”</p>

<p>“She is,” said Paul, innocently. “She’s always
wanting to show me off; that’s why I hate it so.”</p>

<p>“We should not hate to do anything that gives
other people pleasure,” said Miss Polly gently.</p>

<p>Paul reddened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“I don’t hate singing for you,” he said, bluntly.
“I’d do it every day, only we’re going back to Boston
next Monday. Would you like to have me say
some poetry?”</p>

<p>“I would indeed,” said Miss Polly, whereupon
Paul proceeded to give them “Young Lochinvar,”
“The Baron’s Last Banquet,” and several more of
the famous old ballads, known to almost every
schoolboy of the past generation. He had been
well taught, and as he was really fond of poetry,
the recitations were given in a spirit which quite
thrilled the younger members of his audience.</p>

<p>“You really are an awfully clever boy, Paul,” remarked
Molly, in a tone of some awe, at the conclusion
of “Bingen on the Rhine.” “Aunt Julia
always said you were, but since we’ve known you
we thought perhaps she might have made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“That’s because I don’t like showing off,” said
Paul, quite unruffled by this rather uncomplimentary
observation. “I don’t mind doing things for Miss
Polly, though. I say, Miss Polly, if you’d like to
have that organ-man with the monkey come every
day, I think perhaps I could arrange it. I’ve got
’most three dollars, and I could leave it with the
girls, and tell them to give him ten cents every time
he came. An organ-man will come very often to a
place if he knows he’s going to get ten cents every
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Miss Polly laughed her old merry laugh, and then
she suddenly drew Paul to her side.</p>

<p>“You dear, kind little boy,” she said, and before
the embarrassed Paul fully realized her intention,
she had kissed him.</p>

<p>Paul drew away; he had grown very red.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to have anybody kiss me except
Mother,” he said, ungraciously, “but I’d be real
glad to leave that money for the organ-man.” But
in spite of the ungracious words, Paul was not
nearly so much offended as he would like to appear,
and perhaps Miss Polly understood, for she only
smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we must go now,” said Dulcie, rising
reluctantly. “It’s nearly dinner-time, and Aunt
Julia will wonder where Paul is.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have given me a very happy afternoon,”
said Miss Polly, “and I thank you from the
bottom of my heart. It is very kind of you to want
to give me the pleasure of that hand-organ, Paul, but
I think I would a little rather have you spend your
money in some other way. I shall not forget your
offer, though, and I hope you may be able to make
me another visit before you go back to Boston.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she a darling?” exclaimed Molly, the moment
Miss Polly’s door closed behind them, to which
Paul replied, with unusual gravity:</p>

<p>“She’s about the nicest lady I ever saw, and she’s
awfully pretty, too. It must be awful to have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
stay in that room all the time, and never even go
down-stairs. I wish she’d let me do that thing
about the organ-man.”</p>

<p>Although it was later than the children suspected,
fortune favored Paul. His mother had been engaged
with visitors for more than an hour, and
when the front door closed behind the last one, at a
quarter to six, and Mrs. Chester hurried up-stairs
to dress for dinner, she found her small son dutifully
brushing his hair before the mirror.</p>

<p>“Well, and have you and the little girls had
a pleasant afternoon together?” she asked,
kindly.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” answered Paul, giving his red crop a
final pat with the hair-brush. “Dulcie loved the
book. It was the only new present she had, except
the candy the lady from California sent.”</p>

<p>“What is this I hear about a package that came
for Dulcie by express this afternoon?” inquired
Grandma, as the four little girls trooped into the
dining-room at six o’clock. “Mary has been telling
me about it.”</p>

<p>“It was a birthday present from Miss Leslie,”
said Dulcie, “a box of the loveliest candied fruit.
Wasn’t it kind of her to send it, Grandma?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Winslow frowned.</p>

<p>“Candied fruit,” she repeated. “I suppose that
means you have all been eating between meals—a
thing you are strictly forbidden to do. Go up-stairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
at once, and bring the box down here to me. You
should have done so when it first arrived.”</p>

<p>Dulcie gave a little gasp of dismay. It was true
they had all helped themselves from the box, but
that was not by any means the worst thing that had
happened, for in her eagerness to give poor Miss
Polly a present, she had emptied out more than half
the contents of Miss Leslie’s gift. How was
Grandma to be made to understand that they had
not eaten all that fruit themselves, without betraying
their precious secret? She and her sisters might be
willing to assume the rôle of little gourmands, but
would Paul? However, there was no help for it.
No one had ever dared deliberately to disobey
Grandma. So, with an agonized glance at her four
companions, who had all turned a little pale, Dulcie
left the room.</p>

<p>The family were already at the dinner-table when
she returned, carrying the telltale box, which certainly
did feel painfully light, considering its size,
and set it down on the table beside Grandma’s plate.</p>

<p>“It took you long enough to get it,” Mrs. Winslow
said, dryly. “The next time you receive a
present, don’t try to conceal it from me. Just as I
supposed; the box is half empty already.”</p>

<p>“Let me see, Mother,” said Mrs. Chester, anxiously.
“Good gracious, Paul, have you been eating
all those dreadful sweet things between meals?”</p>

<p>“I ate some,” Paul admitted. The little girls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
were all casting imploring glances at the sharer of
their secret.</p>

<p>“Some!” cried Mrs. Chester, reproachfully.
“You must have eaten quantities. What shall I do,
Mother? He is sure to be ill to-morrow; he has
such a delicate digestion.”</p>

<p>“They must all be punished, of course,” was
Grandma’s instant decision. “They have chosen to
make little pigs of themselves, and must take the
consequences. They shall each have a dose of castor
oil before going to bed, and as they cannot possibly
be hungry at present, they can go up to the
nursery, where Mary will bring them each a bowl
of bread and milk, which is all the dinner they
require.”</p>

<p>Paul had grown scarlet. Twice he opened his
lips to speak, and the little girls held their breaths,
but each time he closed them resolutely, and when
the four chairs were pushed back from the table, in
obedience to Grandma’s mandate, he rose with the
rest. His only protest was against the threatened
dose.</p>

<p>“I’ll eat bread and milk if I’ve got to,” he
compromised, “but I won’t take that nasty castor
oil.”</p>

<p>“You will do as you are told,” said Grandma,
sternly, and although Paul’s mother looked distressed,
she dared not interfere.</p>

<p>“Oh, Paul, you are a brave, splendid boy,” whispered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Molly, gratefully, as the five little culprits
went solemnly up-stairs together. “We were so
afraid you were going to tell.”</p>

<p>Paul shrugged his shoulders impatiently.</p>

<p>“I promised I wouldn’t tell,” he said. “Father
says it’s dishonorable to break a promise. I don’t
mind bread and milk very much—it’s better than
soup with onions in it, anyway—but you don’t suppose
she really meant that about the castor oil, do
you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid she did,” said Dulcie. “Grandma
never says things she doesn’t mean. Will you mind
it so very much, Paul? It isn’t so awfully bad if
you take it in orange juice, and drink it very fast, so
you don’t have time to taste.”</p>

<p>Paul made a wry face.</p>

<p>“It’s nasty,” he said. “I never took it but once.
That was when I ate green apples, and Mother
thought I was going to die. I won’t tell, though,
you needn’t be scared, I won’t tell, no matter what
happens.”</p>

<p>They had reached the nursery by this time, and
Dulcie paused in the act of turning up the gas.</p>

<p>“Paul,” she said, impressively, “I think you are
one of the nicest boys in this world. If you’d lived
in the time of the martyrs, I’m almost sure you
would have been one. That saint boy who stood
and shouted that he was a Christian, while they were
shooting him with arrows, was about the bravest one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
I ever read about, but if you’d been alive then, I
believe you’d have done just the same.”</p>

<p>Paul was very much flattered.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I might,” he admitted, modestly. “I’d
like to read about him. Have you got the book?”</p>

<p>“No, I got it out of the library, but I can try to
get it again, if you would like to read it. Do you
think you will really be able to swallow that castor
oil without telling you didn’t eat all that fruit?”</p>

<p>Paul nodded reassuringly.</p>

<p>“I can do anything I make up my mind to,” he
said. “I’d rather do ’most anything than not be
allowed to go and see Miss Polly again. I’ve
thought of lots of interesting things to tell her. I’m
sure she’d like to hear about our telephone.”</p>

<p>“What’s a telephone?” inquired Molly, who had
never heard the word before.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a wonderful thing. It’s like a speaking
tube, only you have to ring a bell, and then you hear
a voice asking what number you want, and you say,
and if it’s the number of your father’s office, and
he’s there, he answers you. Not many people have
telephones in their houses yet, but we have one, and
Father says he wouldn’t be surprised if some day
everybody had them, and you would be talking from
New York to Boston, just as easy as you call down
to Bridget through the tube.”</p>

<p>This last announcement was almost too great a
strain on politeness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Of course you’re just making up a story,” said
Daisy, while Molly and Maud giggled derisively.
“You couldn’t possibly hear your father’s voice
when he was down-town in his office and you were
at home.”</p>

<p>“I can, too,” maintained Paul. “If you ever
come to Boston I’ll show you. Maybe there are
some telephones in New York, but I’m not sure.
Father says Boston is generally ahead of other
places.”</p>

<p>Molly and Maud still looked unconvinced, and
even Daisy would have liked to argue the point, but
Dulcie, who felt that Paul was entitled to a great
deal of consideration that evening, hastened to
change the subject.</p>

<p>“Let’s talk some more about Miss Polly,” she
said rather hurriedly. “Did you see that photograph
of her brother on the bureau? I think he has
a very kind face.”</p>

<p>So no more was said on the subject of telephones,
and in a short time Mary appeared with the five
bowls of bread and milk. The evening that followed
seemed unusually long. It was impossible to
settle down to reading or playing games, with the
awful shadow of castor oil hanging over them.</p>

<p>“I wish Grandma would hurry up and give it to
us,” complained Molly. “Things aren’t as bad
when they really happen as when you’re expecting
them.” Daisy shuddered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Let’s think about something else,” she said.
“Read ‘Little Men,’ Dulcie. Perhaps we’ll get so
much interested we’ll forget about the oil.”</p>

<p>Dulcie consented, but even the fascination of Miss
Alcott’s charming story was powerless to drive away
unpleasant anticipations, and when at eight o’clock
Grandma’s familiar footstep was heard ascending
the stairs, the five little faces were very pale and
troubled. But though Paul was pale, he was resolute.
Not once did his courage fail, and when his
turn came, he swallowed the disagreeable dose without
a murmur.</p>

<p>“I had no idea I should grow so fond of Paul,”
remarked Dulcie to Daisy, when they were all in bed.
“I’m glad we told him about Miss Polly. I know
she loved hearing him sing.”</p>

<p>“Paul is a very nice boy,” agreed Daisy, “but
I’m afraid he doesn’t always tell the truth. That
thing about the telephone couldn’t possibly be
true.”</p>

<p>“It was just a story,” said Dulcie, indulgently.
“People often make up stories just for fun. Why,
it wasn’t any sillier than the story I made up about
the fairy who lives in a music-box, and when people
wound it up, they could hear a real voice singing
inside.”</p>

<p>“But we all knew that was only a make-up,”
objected Daisy. “We knew it wasn’t true. But
Paul really tried to make us believe they had that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
wonderful thing in his house, and he looked so serious
when he was telling it, that if it hadn’t been so
perfectly impossible, I think I should have believed
it was true.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>DAISY WRITES A LETTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE May of 1880 was long remembered as
the hottest spring month in many years.
Not a drop of rain fell between April and
June, and for weeks the sun poured down upon the
city streets, with almost the scorching heat of July.
Many people left town earlier than usual, and the
ferries and the near-by beaches were thronged with
tourists, in search of a cool breeze. But in the Winslow
house things went on much as usual. For
years it had been Mrs. Winslow’s custom to remain
in town until June fifteenth, on which date she
moved her household to the old family homestead
on the Hudson, there to remain for precisely three
months, and she was not a person to be turned from
a custom of years by a little hot weather.</p>

<p>How the children longed for Lizzie, and the trips
to Central Park. The daily walk in Washington
Square seemed very tame and uninteresting in comparison,
and on some afternoons the heat there was
almost unbearable. But they were not allowed to
venture farther from home, and without car-fare the
trip to Central Park was an impossibility. Lessons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
became a daily drudgery, which even Dulcie dreaded,
and Miss Hammond was so tired and nervous, after
a long winter’s work, that she was not much better
able to teach than her pupils were to study.</p>

<p>Daisy, who was not very strong, suffered more
than the others, and became so pale and languid that
even Grandma noticed it, and administered a most
disagreeable tonic three times a day, which made the
approach of meal-times a veritable nightmare to the
child. The tonic helped Daisy’s appetite, but did
not cure the headaches, and the little girl spent more
than one hot afternoon lying on the nursery sofa,
while Dulcie or Molly sponged her forehead with
cold water drawn from the tap in the bath-room.</p>

<p>It was a broiling Sunday afternoon, towards the
end of the month, and Daisy was just recovering
from one of those distressing headaches. The
others had all gone to afternoon service, with
Grandma and Aunt Kate, but she had been excused,
because she had grown so white and faint during
the morning service that Grandma had been obliged
to send her out of church before the sermon, with
Molly to look after her, and take her home. But a
long nap on the sofa, with her head swathed in a wet
towel, had cured the headache, and as the clock
struck four she awoke to the realization that she
was feeling much better.</p>

<p>“I believe I’ll go and see Miss Polly,” she decided,
after a little reflection. “We haven’t any of us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
been for more than a week, and if I try to read my
head may get bad again.”</p>

<p>So she rose from the sofa, and having removed
the wet towel, and smoothed her hair, started for
her call. But just outside the nursery door she
paused, and her face brightened.</p>

<p>“I’ll run down to the yard first, and pick her a
bunch of syringa,” she said to herself. “The bush
is all out, and Grandma will never notice if I take
a little. Miss Polly loves flowers.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, instead of going to the trunk-room,
she ran down the three flights of stairs to the dining-room,
and out through the open French window, to
the little balcony, from which a flight of steps descended
to the back yard. It was a large sunny
yard, and in old Dr. Winslow’s time had been quite
a garden, but Grandma did not take much interest
in flowers, and there was little of the garden left,
except a syringa-bush and a few rose-bushes, which
seldom bloomed until after the family had gone
away for the summer. It was Mary’s Sunday out,
but Bridget was entertaining visitors in the kitchen.
Daisy could hear their voices, as she hastily plucked
a small bunch of the fragrant flowers. She dared
not take many, lest Grandma should notice, and ask
awkward questions. She was just turning back to
the steps, when her ear caught some words uttered
by one of Bridget’s visitors.</p>

<p>“She’s awful bad,” the woman was saying; “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
don’t believe she’ll last the summer through. It’s a
terrible pity, for a sweeter, kinder little thing never
lived in this world, and as to her patience, stayin’ all
day long, with never a soul to speak to, it just makes
you ashamed to complain about anything yourself.”</p>

<p>Daisy stood still, and her heart gave a sudden
throb. Could they be talking of Miss Polly? She
remembered that Bridget and Mary knew some of
the servants in the boarding-house next door.</p>

<p>“Ain’t she got nobody belongin’ to her?” Bridget
asked, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“She’s got a brother somewhere, but I guess he
don’t care much about her. He never comes to see
her, anyhow. If Miss Collins was at home I
wouldn’t worry, but she’s gone off to take care of
her sick sister in Virginia, and Mrs. Brown, who’s
looking after the house while she’s away, don’t take
no more interest in poor little Miss Polly than if she
wasn’t there at all. Why, the poor thing don’t eat
enough to keep a canary alive, and she’s gettin’
paler and thinner before your eyes.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you wouldn’t dare have a doctor to
see her, would you, Maggie?” put in another voice.</p>

<p>What Maggie answered Daisy did not wait to
hear. She had heard enough already, and her heart
was very heavy, as she mounted the steps, with her
precious flowers. Until that moment she had not
realized how much she had grown to love Miss
Polly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“She mustn’t die, oh, she mustn’t!” thought the
little girl, winking back the rising tears. “Oh, if
she would only write to her brother, and tell him all
about everything!” And she thought of the kind,
handsome face in the photograph on Miss Polly’s
bureau.</p>

<p>But by the time she reached her friend’s door, she
had succeeded in controlling the desire to cry, although
her voice had not quite its usual cheerful
sound. Miss Polly seldom came to the door now,
and this afternoon she was not even in her wheel-chair,
but lying upon her bed, reading her Bible.
But her greeting was as hearty as ever, and she
buried her face in the bunch of syringa, with a little
cry of delight.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear,” she said, joyfully, “you don’t
know what a pleasure you have brought me. It is
so odd; I was dreaming last night of my old home
in Vermont, and I could see the syringa-bush that
grew by the parsonage gate. It was all so real that
when I woke it seemed as if I must have really been
there. Would you mind putting these in water for
me? There’s an extra glass on the wash-stand. I
can’t bear to have them fade, and if you stand the
glass on the little table beside my bed, I can look at
them and smell them all the evening. I am afraid
I have been very lazy to-day. It was so warm this
morning, and I felt so tired, that I thought I would
just lie in bed for a while, and later it seemed hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
worth while getting up for such a few hours. It’s
Maggie’s day out, too, and I don’t like to trouble her
more than I can help. Oh, how nicely you have
arranged the flowers! Now come and sit down,
and tell me all about what you have been doing
lately.”</p>

<p>Daisy complied, but as she talked, telling of the
little every-day happenings, it seemed as if her heart
grew heavier and heavier. How thin Miss Polly’s
hands were, and there surely did not used to be those
great hollows in her cheeks. Try as she might, she
could not always keep the quiver out of her voice.
Miss Polly’s quick ear did not fail to notice the
fact.</p>

<p>“What is it, dearie?” she asked gently, laying
a soft little hand on Daisy’s. “Is something troubling
you? Don’t you feel well to-day?”</p>

<p>“Not very,” Daisy admitted, glad of this excuse;
“I’ve had a headache all day. I had to go out of
church before the sermon, and Grandma didn’t like
it. I think she was afraid I pretended my head was
worse than it was, but I didn’t really.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you didn’t,” said Miss Polly, smiling,
“although I have heard of ‘Sunday headaches’
before. My brother Tom used to have them when
he was a boy, and Father finally cured him by insisting
that if he were not able to go to church, he
must go to bed, and stay there for the rest of the
day. It proved quite a wonderful cure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>Daisy laughed, but in a moment she was grave
again.</p>

<p>“I wish Grandma would believe us,” she said.
“We don’t tell stories, but she thinks we do, and it
makes Dulcie so angry. We try to remember that
she’s an old lady, and that we are only her step-grandchildren,
anyway, but it is a little hard sometimes,
especially when we know she doesn’t like
having us stay with her. Paul heard his mother say
we were an incumbrance. Dulcie looked up that
word in the dictionary, and it means the same thing
as being a burden.”</p>

<p>Involuntarily Miss Polly’s thin fingers closed
more tightly over the little hand she was holding.</p>

<p>“How soon is your father coming home?” she
asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Daisy’s face brightened.</p>

<p>“Oh, we are very happy about that,” she said;
“we think he may come this summer. He hasn’t
promised, but in his last letter he said we might see
him sooner than we expected, and we expected him
next winter, anyway.”</p>

<p>“That is good news indeed,” said Miss Polly,
heartily, “although I suppose it will mean that I
shall lose my little neighbors. By the way, won’t
you be leaving town for the summer before long?”</p>

<p>“Not till the fifteenth of June,” said Daisy.
“Grandma says that makes a long enough summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
for her. She doesn’t enjoy the country as much as
we do.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly sighed, and glanced lovingly at her
bunch of syringa.</p>

<p>“The country must be very beautiful just now,”
she said a little wistfully. “Tom wrote me the
lilac-bush in his garden was in full bloom. I should
love to see blooming flowers again.”</p>

<p>“If you wheel your chair into the back room you
can see our syringa-bush,” suggested Daisy. “Next
month there will be some roses, too, but of course a
back yard isn’t like the real country. Do you love
the country very much, Miss Polly?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, I love it more than words can express.
I lie here thinking of it these warm days,
and almost every night I dream of my little room
at home. There used to be a robin’s nest in the
tree just outside my window. I hope the people
who live in the parsonage now keep the lily bed
weeded; Father was so proud of that bed.”</p>

<p>“Your brother lives in the country, doesn’t he?”
Daisy asked, rather timidly.</p>

<p>“Yes, right on the shore of Lake Michigan. It
is only half an hour by train from Chicago, but Tom
says the country is lovely. I have been writing to
Tom to-day, and I think it was the hardest letter I
have ever had to write, because I was obliged to say
something that I knew would cause him pain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Polly, why?” cried tender-hearted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
Daisy. “He’s so fond of you. Did you really
have to make him unhappy?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid so, dear, and the thought is very
hard to bear. I had a letter from him yesterday,
such a dear, kind letter.”</p>

<p>“Does he want you to come and make him a
visit?” inquired Daisy, in a tone of breathless interest.</p>

<p>Miss Polly nodded.</p>

<p>“He and Helen want me to come and spend the
summer. This is Tom’s fourth letter on the subject,
and I have had two from Helen besides. I
have had to make such foolish, shallow excuses, and
now I am afraid Tom will be hurt, and think I don’t
care to come to them.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly broke off abruptly, and hastily brushed
away a tear. It was the first tear Daisy had ever
seen the cheerful little invalid shed.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Miss Polly,” she pleaded, “please,
please don’t be unhappy. Why do you keep on not
telling, when you know your brother loves you so
much? Don’t send that horrid letter. Write another
one, and tell him you’ll come. If you’re too
tired to write, I’ll write for you, and you can tell me
what to say. Oh, Miss Polly dear, please,
please!”</p>

<p>But for once Miss Polly did not heed her little
neighbor. She had buried her face in the pillow,
and was sobbing as if her heart would break.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“It’s all my pride, my foolish, wicked pride,” she
moaned. “I can’t bear to be a burden. I cannot
bear to have Tom know how I have failed. He
didn’t want me to come to New York by myself.
We almost quarrelled about it. And all these years
I have been deceiving him—letting him think I had
succeeded in my plans—oh, my dear, my dear, I
have done very wrong, and now I am ashamed to
confess the truth.”</p>

<p>The tears of sympathy were streaming down
Daisy’s own cheeks, but at these last words of Miss
Polly’s she could not refrain from a little gasp of
astonishment.</p>

<p>“But you haven’t failed,” she cried, eagerly.
“Oh, how could you possibly think you had?
You’re the most beautiful Christian we ever knew,
and when your brother knows all about it, he’ll be
so proud of you he won’t know what to do. We
were talking about you yesterday, and Dulcie said
she wished she could do something like that, just to
make Papa proud of her. Oh, Miss Polly, please
don’t cry any more; it makes me cry too, and I’m
afraid it’ll bring my headache on again.”</p>

<p>“No, no, dear, I won’t,” and Miss Polly made a
hasty search for her handkerchief. “I am a foolish
little woman to say I know, but I haven’t been
feeling very well lately, and I suppose things bother
me more than they would otherwise. Now we are
not going to talk any more about unpleasant things.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
I want to hear about Paul. Have you had a letter
from him lately?”</p>

<p>Daisy stayed for another half-hour, and Miss
Polly did her best to seem cheerful, and to take an
interest in all she was told, but it was easy to see
the effort was a painful one, and at last the little girl
rose to go, fearing she had stayed too long already.
Miss Polly seemed very tired, and, contrary to her
custom, did not urge her visitor to stay longer.</p>

<p>“Will you do something for me, dear?” she said,
as Daisy bent to kiss her good-bye. “I want to get
my letter to Tom posted this evening, and I am
afraid it will be too late when Maggie comes home.
I didn’t finish writing until after she went out. It’s
right here on the table, all stamped and ready to go.
Would it be too much trouble to take it to the letter-box
at the corner?”</p>

<p>“Of course it wouldn’t be too much trouble,”
said Daisy, “only—only——” A warning glance
from Miss Polly checked the impetuous words of
protest, and with another kiss, she hurried away, in
her hand the letter that was to carry to Tom Oliver
the news that his sister “preferred spending the
summer in New York.”</p>

<p>Daisy did not take the letter at once to the post-box
on the corner. On the contrary, she carried it
back to the nursery, and there laid it down on the
desk, where she continued to stare at it for several
minutes. She was very pale, but there was a bright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
excited expression in her eyes, and her hands
twitched nervously. Suddenly she went over to the
bed she shared with Dulcie, and dropping down on
her knees beside it, closed her eyes, and folded her
hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear God,” she whispered, “please forgive
me if what I am going to do is very dreadful. I
can’t let poor Miss Polly go on being so unhappy; I
am afraid she may die, and then her brother will feel
so terribly to think he never knew about how brave
and wonderful she’s been. Please tell me if I ought
to write the letter, and don’t let Miss Polly be very
angry with me when she knows. Amen.”</p>

<p>For a few moments the room was very still.
Then Daisy rose, and there was a look of settled
determination on her face.</p>

<p>“I think God wants me to do it,” she said, unconsciously
speaking out loud. “I feel as if He
was telling me I ought to do it.” And, without
further hesitation, she seated herself at the desk,
and having selected a sheet of paper, began to write.
This is what she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Oliver</span>:</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t think it very queer to get
a letter from a person you don’t know, but I am only
a little girl, and if what I am doing is wrong, will
you please forgive me? I am afraid Miss Polly
will be very angry at first, but perhaps she won’t
afterwards, because I am almost sure she would like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
to have you know about everything, only she is
afraid to tell you herself. She is very proud, and
she doesn’t want to be a burden, but she loves you
better than any one in the world, and it makes her
terribly unhappy to have to hurt your feelings.</p>

<p>“My name is Daisy Winslow, and I live next
door to Miss Polly. My sisters and I go to see her
very often, and she says she has told you about us.
We all love her dearly, and it made us very sad
when she had to sell her piano, because the bank
failed. She was very brave about it, and tried to
make us think she didn’t mind, but we could see by
her eyes that she did. She used to sing and play a
great deal, and we loved hearing her. I think she
was quite happy while she had her piano, even
though she did have to stay in a wheel-chair all the
time, and could never go out, but now she is ill, and
she seems to get thinner every time we see her. I
went to see her this afternoon, and she told me how
you wanted her to come and spend the summer, and
how she had to pretend she didn’t want to. She
cried about it, and it was dreadful. She is afraid
that if you find out the real reason why she can’t
come, you will be angry because she has deceived
you, but I know you won’t, because she is the
bravest, splendidest lady in the world, and nobody
could possibly help loving her.</p>

<p>“I think perhaps I had better explain a little more,
or you may not be able to understand. You see,
when Miss Polly had that accident, three years ago,
she never really got well. She has had to stay in a
wheel-chair ever since, and the doctors told her she
would never be able to walk again.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t think me interfering for writing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
what Miss Polly didn’t want you to know, but I
love her so, and she is so ill, and I just couldn’t help
it. Please come and see her as soon as you can, and
don’t let her know it even if she should be the least
little bit of a burden. I am sure she couldn’t be a
very big one, because she is so lovely.</p>

<p>“If I have made a great many mistakes in this
letter, please excuse them, for I am only just eleven.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“From your little friend,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Daisy Winslow</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Daisy’s heart was beating very fast, as she slipped
her letter into an envelope, and copied the address
from the other letter on the desk. She dared not
read over what she had written, for fear of losing
courage. It was such a terribly bold, unheard-of
thing that she had done, and yet—Maggie had said
Miss Polly might not live through the summer. She
must get the letter posted quickly, before she had
time to change her mind.</p>

<p>Having addressed and stamped her envelope, she
took the two letters, and without even waiting to get
her hat, she flew down-stairs, and out into the street.
It was only a few steps to the corner where the
letter-box was, and in less than five minutes from the
time she left the nursery both letters had taken the
first step on their journey to Chicago.</p>

<p>When the others returned, half an hour later, they
found Daisy lying on the sofa, with her head buried
in the cushions.</p>

<p>“Why, Daisy,” exclaimed Dulcie, bending over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
her sister in real anxiety, “what is it? Is your head
worse?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t my head,” Daisy answered, lifting a
swollen, tear-stained face from the sofa pillows;
“it’s—it’s—oh, girls, I’ve done the most dreadful
thing, and I’m so frightened I don’t know what I
shall do!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>DECORATION DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE big Decoration Day parade has long
become a thing of the past, but in the days
when the Winslows were children it was
looked upon as one of the principal events of year.
All the State militia came to New York for the occasion,
and the West Point cadets turned out in full
force. For days beforehand people poured into the
city, and hotels and boarding-houses were crowded
to their utmost capacity. The line of march was
down Fifth Avenue from Central Park to Fourteenth
Street, and by eight o’clock in the morning
the street was thronged with eager sightseers.</p>

<p>The Winslows’ house was not on Fifth Avenue,
and as Grandma would not allow the children to
stand in the street, their only hope of seeing the big
parade was the possibility that some one of Grandma’s
friends might invite them to her house.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Livingston Leroy asked us last year,”
Dulcie reminded her sisters. “Perhaps she may
again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope she will!” cried Molly. “Maud
and I couldn’t go last year, and I do love to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
soldiers, and hear the bands. Don’t you hope we
can go, Daisy?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Daisy, but she did not speak
with much enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Poor Daisy was not quite her usual cheerful self
in those days. She went about with such a strange,
absent-minded air that Aunt Kate declared she must
be half asleep, and Miss Hammond completely lost
her patience, and pronounced her “a very stupid
little girl.” Dulcie and Molly were very gentle
with her, but even they had little in the way of comfort
to offer. Nearly a week had passed since the
sending of that letter to Chicago, and as yet no
word had been received in reply.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how she dared do it,” Molly said to
Dulcie, when the two were alone together. “I
wouldn’t have done such a thing for the world,
would you?”</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t,” agreed Dulcie. “And to
think it should have been Daisy of all people! She
never did a bold thing like that before, and she isn’t
nearly as likely to get into scrapes as the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“She’s afraid to go and see Miss Polly,” said
Molly. “She hasn’t been since she sent the letter.
I don’t wonder she’s afraid. I should be, too, if I
had done such an awful thing as write and tell a
lady’s brother something she’d been keeping a secret
from him for three years.”</p>

<p>It was Maud who, on the evening before Decoration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> 
Day, at last brought the glad tidings to the
nursery that a note had come from Mrs. Livingston
Leroy, inviting the whole family to watch the procession
from her windows on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>“She said all the family, but Grandma says only
two of us can go,” finished Maud, ruefully. “Shall
we have to draw lots?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dulcie, though her face had fallen at
the news. “You and Molly must go, of course;
Daisy and I went last year.”</p>

<p>Maud gave a little skip of delight, but Molly
looked grave.</p>

<p>“I hate doing things without you and Daisy,”
she said. “Don’t you think Grandma may change
her mind and let us all go?”</p>

<p>“Grandma never changes her mind,” affirmed
Dulcie, which was, indeed, quite true.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winslow told them all of the invitation, and
added that she would take two of the little girls
with her, but that as to taking four children out of
one household, the idea was not to be considered for
a moment.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Livingston Leroy seems to be a very kind
lady,” ventured Molly. “Do you think she would
mind very much if we all went?”</p>

<p>“I should mind,” returned Grandma, grimly,
“and that is more to the point. You may decide
among yourselves which are to go, and which remain
at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>There was nothing more to be said, and the next
morning, soon after breakfast, Dulcie and Daisy
watched their two younger sisters depart for the
scene of festivities, accompanied by those two stern
guardians, Grandma and Aunt Kate.</p>

<p>“What shall we do this morning?” inquired
Dulcie, turning away from the parlor window with
a sigh. “The nursery is being cleaned, so we
can’t go up there. Shall we stay here or go out on
the sidewalk?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” said Daisy, listlessly. “Dulcie,
have you any idea how long it takes for a letter to
go to Chicago?”</p>

<p>Dulcie shook her head.</p>

<p>“I think it must take some time,” she said, “but
not nearly so long as it takes one to go to California.
I wrote to Uncle Stephen nearly a month ago, and I
haven’t had any answer yet. I’m sure he’ll answer,
because I asked him that very important question,
about whether he’s really going to marry Miss Leslie.
I asked him please to answer as soon as possible,
because if he is going to marry her, we wanted
to begin making the wedding presents.”</p>

<p>“Don’t letters sometimes get lost?” Daisy inquired,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I suppose they do, but not often. I heard that
minister friend of Aunt Kate’s say the United States
Mail was a very remarkable institution. I think it
would be rather nice to go out for a while. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
might see some of the soldiers marching up-town to
join in the parade.”</p>

<p>Daisy acquiesced languidly, and, having procured
their hats, the two little girls went out to walk
slowly up and down the block. It was a very
hot morning, and after half an hour of this
monotonous exercise, even Dulcie’s spirits began to
flag.</p>

<p>“I guess we may as well go in,” she decided.
“All the soldiers must be in the procession by this
time, and I’d rather read than stay out here any
longer. I got a very interesting book from the
library yesterday. It’s called ‘Violet, or Through
Cross to Crown.’ I’ll read it aloud to you if you
like.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Daisy, and accordingly they
turned their steps in a homeward direction.</p>

<p>They had just reached their own steps when a
cab drew up before the house next door, and for
some unaccountable reason, Daisy’s heart suddenly
began to beat very fast indeed.</p>

<p>“Look, Dulcie,” she whispered, grasping her sister’s
arm; “there’s a gentleman getting out, and
there’s a lady inside, with a baby in her lap.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” inquired Dulcie in surprise.
“They’ve probably come to see somebody in the
boarding-house. You don’t mean to think——”
She paused in sudden excitement.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Daisy, who was beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
to tremble. “I couldn’t see the gentleman’s face,
he went up the steps so fast, but—but it might be;
it really might.”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the top of their own
steps, and Dulcie had rung the door-bell.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we can possibly find out,” she
said, as they stood waiting for Mary to let them in.
“Oh, see, he’s coming down again; he must have
made a mistake in the house.”</p>

<p>Daisy leaned forward eagerly, in the hope of getting
a glimpse of the stranger’s face, and at that
moment Mary opened the door.</p>

<p>“Well, ain’t you coming in?” she inquired, rather
impatiently, for both children appeared completely
absorbed in the actions of a strange young man, who
was speaking to a lady in a cab. The street was
very quiet, and the little girls could hear every word
he said.</p>

<p>“It’s that house,” the young man was saying, and
as he spoke, he glanced directly up at the Winslows’
front door. “Will you get out, or shall I make
some inquiries first?”</p>

<p>“We may as well all get out,” the lady answered,
and the next moment the baby had been transferred
from its mother to its father, and a very pretty
bright-faced young woman had stepped out of the
cab.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter?” demanded Mary,
still more impatiently. “If you don’t want to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
in, what did you bring me all the way down-stairs to
answer the bell for?”</p>

<p>“They’re coming up here,” gasped Daisy, “and
it is—oh, Dulcie, I’m sure it is.”</p>

<p>“Is the name of one of these little girls Daisy
Winslow?” inquired the young man, as he came up
the steps, and though his voice was kind, and
his face very pleasant, Daisy shrank behind her
sister, in a fit of uncontrollable shyness and embarrassment.
So it was Dulcie who answered the question.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” she faltered, “that is, at least—I am
Dulcie Winslow. Do you want to speak to my sister
Daisy?”</p>

<p>“I do very much indeed. May we come in? My
name is Oliver, and I think you know my sister, who
lives next door.”</p>

<p>Just how it all happened Dulcie and Daisy could
never clearly recall, but in a very short space of
time, they had gone into the house, passed the astonished
Mary, and were seated in the parlor; the
baby, once more restored to her mother’s lap, gazing
about her, with an air of serene content, and uttering
little crows and gurgles of satisfaction. Daisy’s
first impulse had been to escape, but on second
thought she decided that it would be cowardly to
leave Dulcie alone, to take the consequences of
whatever might be in store for them, so she stayed
where she was, and, after all, there was nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
very alarming in the young man’s few words of
explanation.</p>

<p>“I received a letter a few days ago,” he began, as
soon as they were all seated, and Mary, still very
much puzzled, and not at all sure of the wisdom of
admitting strangers in the absence of Mrs. Winslow
and her daughter, had closed the front door. “It
was signed Daisy Winslow, and the writer said she
was a little girl who lived next door to my sister
Miss Oliver.”</p>

<p>“I wrote it,” said Daisy, desperately. “Are
you Miss Polly’s brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” the young man answered, and he
held out his hand with such a kind, friendly smile,
that all Daisy’s fears melted away on the instant.</p>

<p>“I want to thank you for telling me what you
did in that letter, but I must ask a few more questions
before seeing my sister. That is why we
came here first. This is my wife, Mrs. Oliver.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you’ve brought her,” cried
Daisy, joyfully, “and the baby, too. Miss Polly
will be so happy to see you all. She’s got your pictures,
and she’s told us so much about you, and—and—oh,
I am so glad, so glad!” Suddenly Daisy’s
over-strained nerves gave way, and she began to cry.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Oliver who drew the trembling child
down beside her on the sofa, and soothed and comforted
her while her husband questioned Dulcie.
The letter had been a great shock to him, he said;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
he had never dreamed that his sister was not perfectly
well. Could Dulcie give him any particulars
of the case? And Dulcie, only too glad to tell him
dear Miss Polly’s story, told all she knew of the
little cripple’s courage and unselfishness. The story
lost nothing in the telling, and before it was finished
Mrs. Oliver was crying softly, and there were tears
in her husband’s eyes as well.</p>

<p>“She’s the dearest, loveliest person,” finished
Dulcie, with a catch in her voice, and Daisy added
pleadingly:</p>

<p>“You’re not angry with her, are you, Mr.
Oliver?”</p>

<p>“Angry,” repeated Miss Polly’s brother huskily,
“no, indeed, how could I be? God bless her. It
has been a wretched mistake, that’s all, and I am
very much to blame for not having come to see her
long before this, and found out for myself how matters
were. I think we can go now, Helen; there
doesn’t seem to be any more to hear.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Oliver looked a little doubtful.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think she ought to be prepared first?”
she suggested. “The shock of seeing us so unexpectedly
might be bad for her, if she is not strong.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” Tom Oliver admitted.
“I was so anxious to see the dear little woman that
for the moment I forgot everything else. We had
better see Miss Collins, and get her to break the
news.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Miss Collins has gone away,” said Dulcie.
“Her sister was ill, and she went to take care of her.
A Mrs. Brown is keeping the house while she’s
away, and I don’t think she knows Miss Polly very
well.”</p>

<p>Mr. Oliver looked a good deal perplexed.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” he inquired of his wife.
“I suppose we had better see this Mrs. Brown, at
any rate.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliver glanced doubtfully from her husband
to the two little girls.</p>

<p>“Do you think you could do it?” she asked.
“You have both been very kind to Miss Polly, and
I know she loves you.”</p>

<p>“I think we could,” said Dulcie. “I’ve read
about breaking news to people, and I know you
mustn’t do it too suddenly. Oh, Mrs. Oliver, may
Daisy and I tell Miss Polly?”</p>

<p>“I think you may,” said Mrs. Oliver, smiling.
“I am sure they can be trusted, Tom.”</p>

<p>Mr. Oliver nodded, and they all rose. It was
then that Mary, who had remained in the background,
an interested spectator of the whole scene,
stepped forward with a word of protest.</p>

<p>“Where are you all going?” she inquired, suspiciously.
“You children can’t go running off with
people you don’t know. Your grandma would be
very angry.”</p>

<p>“We’re only going next door to see Mr. Oliver’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
sister,” Dulcie explained. “We know her very
well, and we often go to see her, so it’s all right.”
And without further explanation, she pushed past
the still unconvinced Mary, and two minutes later
was ringing the door-bell of the boarding-house next
door.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a maid, who looked more
than a little surprised at the sight of so many visitors,
but when Mr. Oliver gave his name, and
added that he had come to see his sister, the woman’s
face brightened perceptibly.</p>

<p>“The Lord be praised!” she ejaculated. “Miss
Polly’ll be that glad to see you. I’ll run right up,
and tell her you’re here.” She was already half-way
up the first flight of stairs, when Mr. Oliver
called her back.</p>

<p>“I think we will let these little girls go up
first,” he said. “I am afraid the shock of seeing
us without any preparation might be too much
for my sister. I hear she has not been well
lately.”</p>

<p>Maggie—for it was the faithful Maggie—looked
rather disappointed, but was forced to submit. And
then Daisy had an inspiration.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we take the baby?” she asked, eagerly,
appealing to Mrs. Oliver. “Miss Polly loves
babies. One of the boarders brought her little
nephew to see her once, and she enjoyed it so much.
We wouldn’t tell her whose baby it was, just at first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
you know. It would be just like doing a thing in a
book.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliver glanced at her husband.</p>

<p>“I think baby would be good,” she said, “but
how about carrying her up-stairs?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what you might do,” broke in
Maggie, who was almost as much excited as the
children themselves. “The room next Miss Polly’s
is vacant just now. You might all come up, and
you and the gentleman wait there, while the children
take the baby in.”</p>

<p>This suggestion was eagerly adopted, and the
whole party proceeded up-stairs. As they climbed
flight after flight, the little girls noticed that Miss
Polly’s brother grew very grave and silent, and when
they reached the top floor, he gave the baby to
Dulcie, without a word. There was a moment of
breathless anxiety lest baby Oliver should spoil
everything by beginning to cry, but she was—as
her mother frequently informed her friends—a remarkably
amiable child and although she looked a
little surprised at being transferred from her father’s
arms to those of a stranger, she made no protest,
and the next moment had seized one of Dulcie’s long
braids, with a crow of delight.</p>

<p>How the children’s hearts beat, as they knocked at
Miss Polly’s door, and turned the handle, in answer
to her gentle “Come in.” The invalid was
not in bed, but in her wheel-chair, engaged in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
darning stockings, but at sight of her little visitors,
and the baby in Dulcie’s arms, she dropped
her stocking, with a little cry of surprise and
pleasure.</p>

<p>“A baby! how adorable! Oh, my dears, where
did it come from? Whose baby is it?”</p>

<p>“She belongs to some people we know,” faltered
Dulcie. “We asked if we might bring her to see
you. We knew you loved babies.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do love them. What a little beauty.
Do you think she would be frightened if you gave
her to me, just for a minute?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think she would,” said Dulcie; “she let
me take her, and she doesn’t seem shy.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly held out her arms, and Dulcie put the
smiling, crowing baby into them, and with a little
cooing sound the invalid cuddled the child to her
heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, the darling,” she murmured, “the precious
little darling! That’s right, put your head down on
my shoulder. You know I love babies, don’t you?
What is her name, Dulcie?”</p>

<p>“Her name is—is Mary,” gasped Dulcie, who
was finding considerable difficulty in keeping the
tremor out of her voice.</p>

<p>“Mary,” repeated Miss Polly, softly; “that is my
little niece’s name, but they call her Polly.”</p>

<p>“They call this one Polly, too,” said Daisy, coming
to her sister’s relief, “at least we think they do.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
We don’t know her father and mother very well.
We never saw them till this morning.”</p>

<p>Daisy was very much embarrassed, but Miss Polly
was too much absorbed in the baby to notice anything
unusual in her manner.</p>

<p>“Look at her dimples,” she cried, admiringly,
“and her hair is going to curl beautifully when she
is a little older.”</p>

<p>“She likes you; she’s patting your cheek,” cried
Daisy, joyfully. “Oh, Miss Polly dear, wouldn’t
you love to have her all the time—to live in the same
house, I mean?”</p>

<p>Miss Polly smiled rather sadly.</p>

<p>“I should never be lonely,” she said, “but I am
afraid I shouldn’t be of much use. What should I
do if the baby cried and wanted something to
eat?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but her mother would be there to take care
of her,” explained Daisy. “She’s got such a pretty
mother, Miss Polly. I’m quite sure you would love
the baby’s mother.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I should,” Miss Polly agreed. “Perhaps
you will bring her to see me some time. Is she
visiting you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Daisy, “she’s—she’s come to see
somebody who lives in this house. The baby’s
father has come too. They stopped at our house
first, because they wanted to ask some questions
about—about the lady they’ve come to see. Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
Miss Polly dear, please don’t look so white and
queer; you—you scare us.”</p>

<p>It was true that Miss Polly had grown very white,
but there was a wonderful light in her eyes, and she
held the baby tight.</p>

<p>“Where are they?” she questioned tremulously.
“I think I am beginning to understand, but, oh, my
dears, how——”</p>

<p>Miss Polly did not finish her sentence, for at that
moment Dulcie—who had been standing by the door—suddenly
threw it open.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Mr. Oliver,” she cried. “Miss
Polly has guessed who you are, and she loves the
baby.” And without waiting for anything more,
she darted away, closely followed by Daisy.</p>

<p>Maggie was waiting for them in the lower hall,
ready to ask innumerable questions, but she waited
in vain, and when, at the end of half an hour, she
ventured up-stairs, to listen outside Miss Polly’s
door, there was no sound of children’s voices to be
heard. There were other voices, though; Miss
Polly’s with a ring of gladness in it that Maggie had
never heard before, and her brother’s, low and full
of tenderness. The pretty sister-in-law spoke, too,
and once the baby crowed, but where were the children?
Maggie was so puzzled that at last she could
not endure the suspense any longer, and knocked
softly at the closed door.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Miss Polly,” she apologized, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
Mr. Oliver had opened the door, “but can you tell
me where the little girls from next door are?”</p>

<p>“They must have gone home,” Miss Polly answered.
“They left here some time ago.”</p>

<p>“They never came down-stairs,” Maggie objected.
“I’ve been waiting in the front hall all the
time. I think they must be hiding somewhere.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly laughed her old merry laugh, that nobody
in the boarding-house had heard in months.</p>

<p>“They are not hiding,” she said. “They have
probably gone home through the mysterious door in
the wall.”</p>

<p>Dulcie and Daisy were very happy as they made
their way, for the last time, through the familiar
housemaid’s closet, to their own trunk-room, but
their troubles were not yet over. In the excitement
of the moment they had quite forgotten the important
fact that Mary was cleaning the nursery. Now
it happened that at the very moment when the two
little figures emerged from the trunk-room, Mary
had gone out into the hall, and the sight that met her
eyes was so astonishing that, as she afterwards expressed
it to Bridget, “she nearly dropped down
stone dead on the spot.” Explanations followed,
and Mary was made acquainted with the famous
door in the wall.</p>

<p>“Grandpa had it cut through when his brother
lived here,” Dulcie explained. “They were both
writers, and they had their studies up here on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
top floor. The door was so they could go from one
study to the other without having to go down-stairs.
We’ve known about it for a long time, but we
couldn’t tell, because we were afraid Grandma would
fasten it, and then we couldn’t go to see poor Miss
Polly. But now we don’t care whether Grandma
fastens the door or not, because of course Miss
Polly’s brother will take her home with him, and we
won’t want to go in next door any more.”</p>

<p>Mary looked down thoughtfully at the two
flushed little faces.</p>

<p>“If Mrs. Winslow finds out there’ll be a fuss,”
she remarked. “Maybe I can fasten the door myself;
I see there’s a bolt.”</p>

<p>“You mean you won’t tell Grandma?” cried
Dulcie, scarcely able to believe in their good fortune.</p>

<p>Mary did not answer, but going to the door, she
seized the heavy bolt, and with one turn of her
strong fingers, fastened it securely.</p>

<p>“There,” she said, “I guess that’s safe enough.
Nobody can get in here from the other side, anyway.
I can’t see there’s any call to say any more about it.
I’ve heard of that poor lady next door, and I guess
it’s a good thing you went to cheer her up once in
a while. I’m glad her brother’s come to look after
her.”</p>

<p>So Grandma was not told of the door that had
remained unfastened for so many years, and when
Molly and Maud returned, they were regaled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
such a wonderfully exciting story of the morning’s
happenings, as fairly took away their breath, and
caused them to almost forget to describe the parade.</p>

<p>“It’s just exactly like a book thing,” Molly declared,
“breaking the news to Miss Polly and all,
but I wish you hadn’t run away so quick. It would
be so interesting to know what they all did.”</p>

<p>Daisy blushed.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t have stayed,” she said. “It was
all so sort of solemn, you know, and beautiful. Perhaps
we can go in again this afternoon—not through
the door in the wall, that’s bolted—but when we are
out for our walk. We can find out how Miss Polly
is then, and you must see that adorable baby.”</p>

<p>When the four little girls presented themselves at
the invalid’s door that afternoon, they found a very
different Miss Polly from the one they had left a
few hours earlier. There was a bright color in her
cheeks, and a light in the eyes that had looked so
sad and wistful of late. Miss Polly was alone, for
her brother and sister-in-law had gone away to the
hotel, where they were to pass the night.</p>

<p>“Tom is coming to see me again this evening,”
she told them, and in her voice was a ring of wonderful
new happiness. “Oh, children, I can’t help
feeling as if it must be a dream, and that I shall
wake up after a while. I have dreamed of this before,
but I never believed it would come true.”</p>

<p>“Then—then you’re not very angry,” whispered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Daisy, nestling close to her friend. “I was so
afraid you would never forgive me for writing that
letter. Dulcie and Molly thought I ought not to
have done it, but, oh, Miss Polly dear, I couldn’t
help it. You were so unhappy that day, and you
said it was your pride, and—and——”</p>

<p>“My dear little girl,” interrupted Miss Polly, putting
her arm round her tenderly, “I couldn’t possibly
be angry with any one to-day, much less with
some one who has been the means of bringing me
this great joy. I would not advise you to make a
practice of trying to arrange your friends’ affairs,
but in this case it has turned out all right.”</p>

<p>Daisy grew scarlet, and hid her burning face on
Miss Polly’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I’ll never do such a thing again,” she promised.
“Oh, Miss Polly, I’ve been so worried ever since I
wrote that letter. It was such a relief when your
brother came, and I knew he wasn’t going to be
angry.”</p>

<p>“No, dear, he wasn’t angry,” Miss Polly answered
softly. “It is all very wonderful. Think
of it, children, Tom and Helen really want me to
come and live with them. Helen came all the way
from Chicago with Tom, to tell me herself how
much she wanted me. Tom can’t be away long, so
we are starting the day after to-morrow. Miss
Collins will be back to-night, and I know she will
understand, and be glad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Dulcie sighed.</p>

<p>“We shall miss you very much,” she said, “but
we can write to each other, and it will be lovely to
think of you in that pretty little house you used to
tell us about. Papa is coming home soon, and he
says we are to have a home of our own, just as we
had before Mamma died, so perhaps we won’t be
here next winter either.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” said Miss Polly. “I shall never
forget my dear little neighbors, and all they did to
make me happy.” She laid her hand lovingly on
Daisy’s head as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Grandma never found out about the door,” said
Molly, “and now it’s bolted, so nobody can use it
any more. We wrote Papa about it, but we haven’t
had any answer yet; it takes such a long time for a
letter to come from China. Miss Leslie thought it
was all right, though. I wish you could know Miss
Leslie, she’s so sweet and dear. We tell her about
everything, and she answers all our letters. We
hope she’s going to marry Uncle Stephen, but we’re
not sure. Dulcie’s written to ask him, but he hasn’t
answered yet.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly smiled.</p>

<p>“You all seem very fond of writing letters,” she
said. “I hope you will write to me often, for I
shall be interested in everything you do.”</p>

<p>“I think this has been one of the happiest days
we ever had,” remarked Dulcie, that evening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
when they were all in the nursery, preparing for
bed.</p>

<p>“It’s been lovely,” agreed Daisy, “but there’s
going to be a happier one still, and that will be the
day Papa comes home. I wish we could tell Lizzie
about everything, she’d be so interested, and perhaps
we shall see her when we go to the country,
for Mary says her husband keeps the grocery store
at Glenwood, and that’s only five miles from us.”</p>

<p>“And just think, Grandma and Aunt Kate never
even heard of Miss Polly,” reflected Molly. “They
might be just as happy as we are to-night, if they
only took a little interest in other things besides
missionaries.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>MRS. WINSLOW GETS A TELEGRAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a glorious morning towards the end of
June, and the four little Winslows were comfortably
established under the big apple-tree.
The Winslow Homestead was on the banks of the
Hudson, and from where they sat, the children could
watch the boats on the river, and even hear the
sound of the paddles, as the big excursion steamers
plied their busy way between New York and Albany.
They could look across to the opposite shore, where
the Palisades rose in forms like castles, from the
very brink of the river. It was a beautiful view,
and the children loved it, as their father had loved
it before them. The place had been in the Winslow
family for three generations, and old Dr. Winslow
himself had climbed that very apple-tree when a
boy, and brought down many a shower of half-ripe
apples for his younger brothers and sisters. Dulcie
and Daisy had never wearied of their father’s stories
of his boyhood at the old homestead on the Hudson,
and the two weeks since the family had left the city
had been very pleasant ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“I don’t know why it is, but Grandma always
seems rather nicer in summer than she does in winter,”
Molly had remarked only that morning. “She
doesn’t scold half so much, and she lets us do pretty
nearly everything we want to.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s because there’s so much more room,”
Dulcie decided. “We are not so much in her way.
I think the less Grandma sees of us, the better she
likes us.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s because Papa’s coming home soon,
and she knows she isn’t going to have us much
longer,” Daisy suggested. “She says I may help
pack the next missionary box. I love to see what
they send to the missionaries, only I wish some of
the ladies wouldn’t send quite such shabby things.
I don’t see how any missionary could possibly use
them.”</p>

<p>But at this particular moment the little girls were
not thinking of Grandma or of missionaries either,
for Dulcie was reading “A Peep Behind the Scenes”
aloud, and for the past hour they had all been completely
absorbed in the story.</p>

<p>“It’s very sad,” remarked Dulcie, pausing at the
conclusion of a chapter to wipe her eyes. “I wish
something horrid would happen to that stepmother,
and Rosalie would hurry and find her Aunt Lucy.”</p>

<p>“Stepmothers must be awful,” said Molly, glancing
up from the tea-cozy she was crocheting. “Almost
every one we’ve read about is cruel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“They are all cruel,” announced Dulcie, in a tone
of conviction. “Let’s look at your book-mark,
Maud. Oh, you are getting all the stitches crooked.
Give it to me, and let me straighten it out for
you.”</p>

<p>Maud relinquished her work quite readily, and
threw herself back in the soft grass.</p>

<p>“It’s the first one I ever made,” she said. “I
don’t believe Miss Leslie will mind even if it is just
a little bit crooked. It’s a wedding present, anyhow,
and people ought not to criticize presents.”</p>

<p>“Your tea-cozy is going to be lovely,” said Daisy,
regarding Molly’s work admiringly. “I’m afraid
my pincushion won’t be half as pretty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it will,” Molly assured her. “Lizzie
always said you sewed better than any of us. I’m
sure Miss Leslie will love your cushion, and Uncle
Stephen, too. Don’t you want one of us to read,
Dulcie, while you work on your tidy?”</p>

<p>Dulcie hesitated.</p>

<p>“I think I’d rather go on reading,” she said. “I
can read faster than the rest of you, and it’s so interesting
about Rosalie and her stepmother. There
really isn’t any hurry about finishing our presents.
We don’t even know when the wedding is to be.”</p>

<p>“I wish Uncle Stephen had told us more about
it,” said Daisy. “It would be so interesting to
think of them on their wedding day, but he only
said he was sure Miss Leslie would like some wedding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
presents, and we could give them to her when
we saw her. He didn’t even say he was going to
marry her himself.”</p>

<p>“Of course he is, though,” said Dulcie, “or else
he would have told us we were mistaken. Perhaps
they are coming east on their wedding trip. Won’t
it be nice to see them again, and to be able to call
Miss Leslie ‘Aunt Florence’? I don’t believe
Grandma will ask them here for a visit, but perhaps
they’ll have us come and spend the day at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel. I guess Grandma would let us if
Uncle Stephen came for us. It’s only an hour on
the train.”</p>

<p>“It would be so lovely that I don’t believe it will
ever happen,” said Dulcie, sceptically. “I’m very
sorry, Maudie, but I’m afraid I shall have to rip this
all out and start over again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said Maud, with unruffled composure.
“I think perhaps Miss Leslie would like it
just as much if I wrote a nice piece of poetry for
her wedding present.”</p>

<p>This suggestion was greeted by a peal of laughter
from the other three, but Maud remained quite
grave.</p>

<p>“I made up one this morning in bed,” she said.
“I think it’s rather pretty.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hear it,” said Dulcie, and Maud, nothing
loth, sat up on the grass and began to recite in a very
sing-song tone:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Oh, the little birds are singing.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, the little flowers are blooming.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, the little calves are happy.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, the little——</div>
</div></div>

<p>I can’t remember the rest, but don’t you think it’s
nice poetry?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t bad, considering your age,” said Dulcie,
indulgently, and Molly added, with real admiration:</p>

<p>“It doesn’t exactly rhyme, but it sounds a little
like ‘Hiawatha.’”</p>

<p>“I think I shall be a poet like Mr. Longfellow
when I grow up,” announced Maud, “and all my
poems will be about the country, because I love it so
much. Miss Polly loves the country, too. Her
letter made me feel so nice and comfortable inside.”</p>

<p>“It’s lovely to think of Miss Polly being so
happy,” said Daisy. “I can’t ever feel sorry I
wrote that letter to her brother, though I don’t believe
I should ever dare do such a thing again.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad it’s only June,” reflected Molly,
“and we can stay here till September. It’s so much
pleasanter than being in New York, especially now
that Miss Polly’s gone away.”</p>

<p>“I should like to be going to Europe with Aunt
Julia and Paul,” said Dulcie. “It must be wonderful
to see different countries, and all the places
you’ve read about in history.”</p>

<p>“Paul doesn’t care about that part of it,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
Molly, and taking from her pocket a crumpled
letter, she read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It will be fun on the ship, and Father says I can
go to the zoo in London, but Mother says travelling
all summer will be as good as studying history, and
I always hated history worse than all the other
lessons, so I don’t believe I shall like Europe much,
and I wish we were going to Nahant instead.”</p>
</div>

<p>“People don’t always appreciate their advantages,
as Miss Hammond says,” quoted Dulcie. “If I
were in Paul’s place, I should want to see every
single thing I possibly could. Oh, here comes the
telegraph boy. I wonder what’s happened.”</p>

<p>Dulcie’s tone had changed to one of excitement,
not unmixed with anxiety. The arrival of a telegram
was rather an unusual event in the Winslow
family, and Dulcie and Maud both sprang to their
feet, and ran to meet the small boy from the village,
who was seen crossing the lawn, with a yellow
envelope in his hand.</p>

<p>“It’s for Grandma,” announced Dulcie, when she
had taken the envelope from the messenger. “I’ll
take it in to her. The boy says there’s ten cents to
collect.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Winslow was in the kitchen, superintending
the putting up of strawberry jam. She was in
the midst of delivering a lecture to Bridget when
Dulcie, flushed and panting, appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“A telegram for you, Grandma,” she said, “and
the boy says there’s ten cents to collect.”</p>

<p>Grandma turned a trifle pale as she held out her
hand for the envelope. Her thoughts instantly flew
to a possible accident in the Chester family, or to
her daughter Kate, who had gone away for a week’s
visit to a friend. But her manner was apparently
as composed as usual, as she took out her purse, and
counted the change.</p>

<p>“He will have to change a quarter,” she said.</p>

<p>Dulcie hurried away, glad of the excuse to return
with the change, and possibly learn the contents of
the telegram. There was a strong probability that
she would not be told, however, for Grandma and
Aunt Kate were always silent about their affairs.
She paid the messenger, received the correct change,
and was on her way back to the kitchen, when she
encountered her three younger sisters.</p>

<p>“It was so exciting, we couldn’t wait any longer,”
Molly explained. “What did Grandma say when
she opened it?”</p>

<p>“She hadn’t opened it when she sent me away,”
said Dulcie, “but I’ve got to go back with the
change, and perhaps she’ll tell me.”</p>

<p>“We’ll come with you,” said Daisy, “but we’ll
wait outside, so as not to seem too curious. If
Grandma thought we were curious she wouldn’t tell
us anything.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, only Dulcie entered the kitchen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
while the other three remained discretely in the
background. Mrs. Winslow had evidently read her
message, for the telegram was nowhere to be seen,
and she was talking to Bridget, who looked as if
she had heard something interesting. At Dulcie’s
entrance, however, Grandma broke off abruptly in
the middle of a sentence.</p>

<p>“Here’s the change, Grandma,” said the little
girl, “and—and I hope it isn’t any bad news.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Winslow, with a rather grim
smile; “I don’t imagine you will consider it bad
news. The telegram was from your father, and it
was sent from Chicago. I have known for some
time that he was on his way home, but thought best
not to tell you sooner. You children get so excited
over things, and you know how much I dislike a
fuss.”</p>

<p>“I’m rather glad Grandma didn’t tell us sooner,”
remarked Dulcie, with a happy laugh. “I really
don’t see how we could have lived if we had known
Papa was on his way home, and not know how soon
he would get here. Oh, girls, isn’t it the most glorious
thing that ever happened?”</p>

<p>It was afternoon, and the four little sisters were
once more in their favorite place, under the big
apple-tree. The first excitement of Grandma’s wonderful
news had, in a measure, subsided, but for the
first few hours it had really seemed quite impossible
to keep still, and at last Grandma, in despair, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
gone out to call on a neighbor, declaring that so
much talking was more than she could endure. But
in spite of her sharp words, Mrs. Winslow had not
looked altogether displeased.</p>

<p>“I think she is a little happy herself,” Daisy said,
as the tall erect figure of the old lady passed out of
the gate. “Of course when Papa comes she won’t
have to keep us any longer, and that will be a great
relief.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we’ve been such a terrible trouble
to her,” said Molly, a little indignantly; “we’ve tried
to be pretty good.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Daisy, “but then, you see,
Grandma doesn’t care much about children, and we
are only steps. If it had been Paul it might be
different.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad we’re not going to be steps any
longer,” cried Dulcie, with shining eyes. “Think
of having a little home all by ourselves with Papa.
I’m so happy I don’t know whether I want to laugh
or cry.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Papa will let you keep house?”
inquired Molly. “You’re twelve.”</p>

<p>“He might,” admitted Dulcie, with becoming
modesty. “I think I could, but I shouldn’t scold
the servants as much as Grandma does. I wonder
where our home will be.”</p>

<p>“I hope it will be in the country,” said Maud.
“Maybe I can have rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“I don’t care where it is,” said Daisy; “I don’t
care about anything but seeing Papa. I suppose he
didn’t tell us he was coming so soon because he
wanted it to be a surprise.”</p>

<p>“Of course that was the reason,” agreed Dulcie,
confidently. “It would have been a surprise, too,
if we hadn’t happened to take in the telegram. I
don’t believe Grandma would have told us anything,
but then we wouldn’t have had the pleasure of anticipating.
I think to anticipate something pleasant is
one of the nicest things, if you don’t have to wait
too long.”</p>

<p>“The telegram was from Chicago,” said Daisy.
“Grandma says Papa may get here to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’m hungry,” announced Maud, somewhat irrelevantly.
“I was so excited about Papa’s coming
home I couldn’t eat any dinner. I don’t see how I
can possibly wait till tea-time.”</p>

<p>“I think we are all a little hungry,” said Dulcie.
“I know I was too excited to eat much dinner.
Grandma doesn’t like to have us eat between meals,
but I don’t believe she’d mind our having a little
bread and butter to-day.”</p>

<p>“Go and ask Bridget for some,” urged Molly.
“She generally gives you what you ask for, and
she’s called you Miss Dulcie since you were
twelve.”</p>

<p>“Ask her to put some brown sugar on it,” charged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
Maud, as Dulcie rose, and walked away in the direction
of the house.</p>

<p>As she approached the back premises, Dulcie
noticed that a horse and buggy were standing outside
the kitchen door. The buggy was empty, and
the horse was fastened to the hitching-post. It was
also evident from the sound of voices in the kitchen
that Bridget was entertaining visitors. Dulcie
paused a moment before going in, and as she did
so, some words fell upon her ears, which set her
heart beating so fast that she could scarcely
breathe.</p>

<p>“It was the madam herself told me,” Bridget was
saying. “She read out the message, and then she
says, ‘the children don’t know a thing about it,’ she
says, ‘and he wants it kept from them till he can tell
them himself.’”</p>

<p>“It’s just too awful, that’s what it is!” cried
another voice. “I never thought he’d do it, him
such a nice, kind gentleman, and so fond of the
first one, too. Oh, the poor lambs; the poor
lambs!”</p>

<p>Dulcie knew that voice, although it was many
months since she had heard it last. Impulsively she
hurried forward, regardless of the fact that there
were several persons in the kitchen, including a
strange young man, with freckles, and very red hair,
and in another moment her arms were round the
neck of a stout, pleasant-faced young woman, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
she was hugging her tight, and laughing and crying
both together.</p>

<p>The young woman returned Dulcie’s embrace
heartily, and at the same time began to cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, my precious!” she cried, “I couldn’t keep
away another minute, I just couldn’t. I heard you’d
moved up for the summer, and I said to Michael—that’s
my husband, dear—I said ‘you’ve got to drive
me over to the old place this afternoon. I’ve got to
see those precious children,’ I said. I didn’t think
your grandma’d have any objections, seeing as I’m
married, and couldn’t come back even if she’d have
me, but O dear, O dear! I never thought to hear such
dreadful news.” And the young woman—who was
a very emotional person—began to sob more violently
than ever.</p>

<p>“But there isn’t any dreadful news, Lizzie; I
don’t know what you mean,” faltered Dulcie, who
was still clinging round her old nurse’s neck.
“Papa is coming home. Grandma had a telegram
from him this morning, and he may be home to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my darling, I know all about it, but
how is he coming home, that’s the question? How
is he coming home to the dear little trusting children
who love him so much?”</p>

<p>“Lizzie, what is it?” cried Dulcie, in sudden
terror; “has something terrible happened to Papa,
that we don’t know about? Is he ill?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“No, no, dearie, he’s well enough, I guess, but—do
stop making signs to me, Bridget; there’s no
reason why she shouldn’t be told. They’ve all got
to know soon.”</p>

<p>“Know what?” questioned Dulcie, gazing with
big frightened eyes from one face to another.
“Something has happened to Papa, I know it has,
and nobody will tell us. Oh! oh!” And Dulcie
burst into tears, and hid her face on Lizzie’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“There, there, Miss Dulcie, don’t take on so,”
soothed Bridget. “Nothing so very bad has happened.
Lizzie always makes a fuss over things.
She don’t know what she’s saying.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, don’t I?” retorted the indignant Lizzie,
“and who should know better, I’d like to ask?
Didn’t I have one myself, and isn’t that the reason
I ran away from home at sixteen, and have been
working for my living ever since? I guess if anybody
in this world knows about stepmothers I do.”</p>

<p>“Stepmothers!” repeated Dulcie, lifting her face,
from which the color had suddenly faded. “Lizzie,
is somebody going to have a stepmother?”</p>

<p>“You are, my lamb,” sobbed Lizzie, and the
words were accompanied by a convulsive hug.
“Your papa is bringing her home to you. He was
married in California last week. Your grandma’s
known it was going to happen ever since last winter,
but it was your papa’s wish you shouldn’t be told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
till he came home and told you himself. Oh, my
poor baby, don’t cry so, don’t now. It’s an awful
thing, I know, and my heart’s just breaking for you
all, but it can’t be helped, and you’ve got to make
the best of it.”</p>

<small>DULCIE TAKES THE HELM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“DAISY, are you asleep?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Daisy, in a smothered
voice, lifting a flushed, tear-wet face
from the pillow. “I’ve tried and tried, but my eyes
won’t stay shut. I thought you might be asleep,
though, so I kept as quiet as I could.”</p>

<p>Dulcie sighed, and slipped an arm round her
sister.</p>

<p>“I can’t go to sleep either,” she whispered; “I
don’t believe I’ve been asleep at all. I’ve been thinking
and thinking, till it seemed as if my head would
just burst. I’m so glad you’re awake, for I must
talk to somebody. We must whisper, though, so as
not to wake Molly and Maud.”</p>

<p>“I think it must be the middle of the night,”
whispered Daisy. “It seems ages since I heard
Grandma lock her door. Oh, Dulcie, hasn’t it been
a dreadful day? I’ve been thinking about stepmothers
ever since I went to bed. Do you suppose
real ones are all as dreadful as the ones in books?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they are,” sighed Dulcie. “They
may not all be wicked. Grandma isn’t wicked, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
I don’t believe she ever made Papa very happy when
he was a little boy. I don’t believe Papa would
marry a lady who was really cruel, but even if she
isn’t, she won’t want us. We shall be the same
bother to her we’ve been to Grandma. That’s the
dreadful part of it. Oh, how could Papa have done
it? He knew we would always stay with him, and
take care of him.” Dulcie’s voice broke in a
sudden sob.</p>

<p>It had, indeed, been a very sad evening for the
four little girls. They had spent it alone, for
Grandma had not come home to tea. She had sent
a note to say the children were not to wait for her,
as she had accepted the invitation of a neighbor to
remain to supper, and go to hear a distinguished
speaker at the town hall. As for Lizzie, chief cause
of all the trouble, she had been driven home by her
husband, a very sad and depressed Lizzie, for every
one had blamed her for telling the children a piece
of news which Mrs. Winslow had strictly forbidden
every member of the household to mention. So the
children had sat on the piazza in the twilight, after
tea, Molly and Maud with their heads on their elder
sisters’ laps, and nobody had talked much. There
really did not seem anything to say, and it had been
a relief to them all when bedtime came. They had
undressed in the same quiet, subdued way, and Molly
and Maud had soon forgotten their troubles in
sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>Dulcie cried softly into the pillow for a few minutes,
while Daisy soothed and comforted her as best
she could, both of them still mindful of their sleeping
sisters in the other bed, for, as in the city, the
four little girls shared the same room. Then Dulcie
pulled herself together again, and began to talk.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking of it for hours and hours,”
she whispered, “and I’ve made up my mind we’ve
got to do something.”</p>

<p>Daisy gasped.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything we can do,” she protested.
“We’ve just got to make the best of it. I’ve been
praying a lot, Dulcie dear, and I think perhaps God
won’t let the stepmother be so very dreadful, after
all. There may be some nice stepmothers, you
know, even if we’ve never heard of them.”</p>

<p>“But there is something we can do,” said Dulcie,
not without a touch of pride in her tone. “I’ve
thought of it. You see, it isn’t as if we were all
little as we were when Mamma died. Then, of
course, we couldn’t do anything for ourselves, and
Papa had to bring us to Grandma, but now you and
I are old enough to earn our living, and even Molly
could work—wash dishes, you know, and shell peas,
and little things like that. Between the three of us
we ought to be able to earn enough to take care of
Maud.”</p>

<p>“Earn our own living!” repeated Daisy, incredulously.
“Why, Dulcie, how could we? Papa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
wouldn’t let us, or Grandma either. Grandma
would say we had disgraced the family, the same as
she did when that cousin of hers went away to be
an actress.”</p>

<p>Dulcie sniffed scornfully.</p>

<p>“We can’t help what Grandma says,” she said.
“Papa won’t think we are a disgrace to the family.
Besides, it will all have to happen before he gets
home. He may not like it just at first, but I don’t
believe he’ll really mind much, because, of course,
it will make the stepmother happy not to have any
burdens.”</p>

<p>“But—but,” faltered Daisy, “Papa is coming
home to-morrow. How can it possibly happen before
that?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s got to,” said Dulcie, firmly. “I’ve
thought it all out, lying here, and it’s really quite a
wonderful plan. Now listen, and don’t interrupt till
I get through. We won’t tell the others anything
till morning, but we’ll have to get up very early, so
as to be away before anybody else is awake. We’ll
dress very quietly, and just slip out of the house
without anybody’s knowing a thing about it.
There’s an old leather bag in the storeroom that I
don’t believe Grandma would mind our taking, and
we can put a few things in it—just necessary things,
you know, like combs and tooth-brushes, and a set
of clean clothes for each of us. We’ll walk to the
station, and take the first train going up the river.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
Isn’t it wonderful that Uncle Stephen should have
sent us that five dollars for the Fourth of July? I
thought we could keep it to buy real birthday presents
for Molly and Maud, but we’ll have to spend it
this way. We’ll buy four tickets for Peak’s Point.
It’s twenty miles off, and nobody knows us there.
Papa took me there once on the boat, and I remember
it was quite a big place, and there were some
lovely houses. We’ll stop at the first house we like
the looks of, and ring the door-bell and ask for
work. Of course they may not want us at the first
one, but we’ll keep right on asking till we find some
one who wants some little girls to help with the
housework. People often do take little girls, you
know. You remember the girl who used to take the
Van Arsdale baby out; I’m sure she wasn’t much
older than I am. We won’t give our real names;
people in books never give their real names when
they run away from home. Don’t you think it’s a
wonderful plan?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” declared Daisy. “I think it’s the
most awful thing I ever heard of in my life. I’m
sure Papa would be very angry. It would be dreadful
not to be here when he gets home to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Dulcie caught her breath in a quickly suppressed
sob.</p>

<p>“I know it,” she choked, “and I feel dreadfully
about it, but it can’t be helped. It isn’t as if Papa
were coming alone, you know; the stepmother will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
be here, too. I promised Mamma to take care of
you all, and I’ve always known a stepmother was
the very worst kind of a ‘step’ there was. Besides,
when Papa finds out we’re supporting ourselves, and
making money, I think he’ll be rather proud of us.
We’ll leave a note, of course—people in books always
leave notes—and when we are settled, we’ll let
people know where we are. We’ve got to do something,
Daisy, we really have. We can’t go on being
burdens, and incum—I can’t remember the rest of
the word, but you know what Paul told us he
heard his mother say we were. It’s a dreadful thing
to feel you are a burden, and I just can’t bear it any
longer.” And Dulcie burst into such a passionate
fit of crying that poor, trembling Daisy was at her
wits’ end to comfort her.</p>

<p>It was a long time before either child closed her
eyes that night. They talked in whispers, or rather
Dulcie talked, for it was she who made all the plans,
while Daisy merely listened, and murmured faint,
frightened little protests. The whole scheme appeared
to her so utterly preposterous and impossible
that at first she thought Dulcie was making up one
of her famous stories, but Dulcie’s was the stronger
nature of the two, and in the end she had her way,
as she generally did with her younger sisters. But
poor little Daisy’s heart was very heavy. Long
after Dulcie had fallen asleep, worn out by excitement,
she lay with wide open eyes, staring into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
darkness, until tears would not be kept back any
longer, and then she cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as the first streaks of sunlight had
made their way through the closed blinds, and while
the birds were still singing their morning chorus,
Dulcie was wide awake again, ready for the day’s
work. She lay still for a few minutes, listening to
the breathing of her sleeping sisters, and then rose
softly, and seating herself at the desk, began to
write. She wrote steadily for the next ten minutes,
and then paused, arrested by a slight rustle from the
bed she had left. Daisy was sitting up, watching
her anxiously, her blue eyes full of trouble.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” she inquired, in a
tremulous whisper.</p>

<p>“Writing that letter to Papa,” Dulcie answered.
“I’m just finishing. You can read what I’ve
written, if you want to. I think it’s rather nice.”</p>

<p>Daisy slipped out of bed and tiptoed softly across
the room to her sister’s side. Leaning over Dulcie’s
shoulder, she read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Darling, precious Papa</span>:</p>

<p>“You will find this letter when you come,
and it will explain why we are not here to welcome
you. We are terribly, terribly sorry not to be here,
but if we waited to tell you our plan, we are afraid
perhaps you would not let us go away at all. Oh,
dear Papa, please don’t be angry with us. I am sure
you wouldn’t be if you knew how very unhappy we
are. We don’t blame you for marrying the stepmother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
because Daisy says you may have been very
lonely. We hope you will be very happy, but we
don’t want to stay and be burdens. It was bad
enough to be burdens to Grandma, but it would be
much worse to be them to a stepmother. So we are
going away to earn our living. Daisy and I can both
sweep and dust very well, and Daisy can cook a little.
She made some very nice cookies the other day;
even Grandma said they might have been worse.
Molly can wash dishes, and wheel a baby carriage,
and once she helped Mary clean silver, so I am sure
she will soon learn to be useful. Maud is too little to
work, but we can earn money enough to take care
of her. We will send you our address just as soon
as we are settled, and will you please tell Grandma
not to worry about the bag. We had to take it to
carry some things in, but we will send it back by
express just as soon as we can.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, darling Papa. We all love you more
than we can possibly say, and we hope you and the
stepmother will be very happy. If you should be a
little angry at first, and disappointed not to find us
here, please don’t blame any one but me, because it
was really all my fault. I thought of the whole
plan, and Daisy didn’t want to do it at all. We
haven’t told Molly and Maud yet, because it is very
early, and they are both asleep, but I am going to
wake them in a few minutes. We must get off
before Grandma wakes, or she might make a fuss.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your own little girl,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Dulcie</span>.</p>

<p>“P. S.—We have plenty of money. Uncle
Stephen sent it in a letter last week. He said it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
for candy and firecrackers for the Fourth, but we
can live on it till we get some work, so please don’t
worry about us any more than you can help.”</p>
</div>

<p>“It’s a beautiful letter,” commended Daisy, wiping
her eyes. “I don’t see how you always know
just the right things to say. Perhaps Papa won’t
be angry when he understands, but it does seem a
dreadful thing not to be here when he comes.”
And Daisy choked back a rising sob.</p>

<p>The next hour was a very busy one for the little
Winslows. In the first place, Molly and Maud had
to be awakened, and the wonderful plan explained
to them. Not an easy task, for at the first mention
of the fact that they were to go away before their
father’s arrival both children began to cry, and
Molly persisted, amid sobs, “that nothing—no,
nothing in the world, not even the cruelest stepmother
one had ever heard of—would induce her to
go anywhere before Papa came home.” But again,
as with Daisy, Dulcie ended in having her own way.
Indeed, she drew such a terrible picture of stepmothers
in general that at last Maud was frightened,
and Molly was forced into a half-hearted consent to
the plan. Then began the preparations for departure.
They had to be very quiet, for Grandma
was a light sleeper, but Dulcie crept up-stairs to the
storeroom, whence she returned with a shabby
leather travelling-bag, and in due time they were
ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“Now we must go down-stairs on tiptoe,” commanded
Dulcie, who, from the beginning, had taken
command of the expedition. “The front door is
locked, but it’s morning, so there can’t be any harm
in leaving it unfastened till Mary and Bridget come
down. They’ll only think we got up early, and
went for a walk. We did it once last summer, you
know. Now, is everybody ready?”</p>

<p>“Where shall we get our breakfast?” Maud inquired,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“We shall have to wait till we get to Peak’s
Point. There are plenty of stores there, and we
can buy something at a baker’s. It will be like a
picnic, you know. O dear! I didn’t think this bag
would be so heavy! I’m afraid we’ve taken too
many things.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem as if we were taking much,” said
Daisy. “I thought we ought each to have an extra
dress, but the bag wouldn’t shut when I tried to put
them in. I really don’t believe we can get on with
any less, Dulcie; we’ve got to be clean, you
know.”</p>

<p>But Dulcie—who had made an attempt to lift
the heavy valise—shook her head resolutely.</p>

<p>“We shall have to get on somehow,” she said, and
promptly began removing the superfluous articles
her younger sisters had so carefully packed.</p>

<p>Daisy sighed, but submitted to the inevitable, and
after taking out some of the heaviest of their possessions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Dulcie declared she could easily carry the bag,
with a little occasional help from the others. They
were a rather pathetic little procession, as they softly
opened their door and tiptoed down-stairs. Dulcie
carried the valise, and each of the other three was
provided with a package as well. Daisy was carrying
the family Bible, carefully wrapped in paper;
Molly was entrusted with their mother’s photograph,
in its gilt frame, and Maud hugged to her bosom her
favorite rag doll, which no amount of persuasion
could induce her to leave behind. As they reached
the lower hall, the big clock on the stairs struck six.</p>

<p>“It’s very early,” whispered Molly. “Do you
suppose there will be any trains?”</p>

<p>“Of course there will,” Dulcie reassured her;
“there are always trains. Now, step very softly
on the piazza. I’m so afraid Grandma may hear
us and get up to look out of the window.”</p>

<p>After all, there was nothing very alarming about
the adventure, and Molly and Maud had not taken
many steps in the fresh morning air before their
spirits began to rise. But Daisy cried softly all the
way to the station, and Dulcie’s face was very stern
and set.</p>

<p>“I think it’s rather fun,” Maud whispered to
Molly, “only I wish we could have had our breakfast
before we started. Just listen to that robin. I
don’t believe robins ever sing like that after breakfast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“Miss Leslie wrote that she loved to go out early
in the morning and study the birds,” said Molly.
“I can’t see what there can be about birds to study,
but she said it was very interesting.”</p>

<p>Maud came to a sudden pause.</p>

<p>“We’ve forgotten Miss Leslie’s wedding presents,”
she exclaimed, in dismay. “We’ll have to go
back for them.”</p>

<p>But Dulcie would not hear of going back, even for
the precious wedding presents, but she promised
Maud they would write Miss Leslie all about everything,
and she would surely understand.</p>

<p>“For you know Miss Leslie is a very understanding
person,” finished Dulcie, “and I’m sure she
won’t blame us for running away from a stepmother,
when we’ve had nothing but steps ever since
we can remember.”</p>

<p>It was only a short walk down the hill to the
station, but when they reached it, they found the
waiting-room still locked up, and not a human being
in sight.</p>

<p>“I knew it was too early for trains,” fretted
Maud. “Now we’ll have to go home again.”</p>

<p>“No, we won’t,” declared Dulcie, with assumed
cheerfulness. “We’ll just wait here till the first
one comes along.”</p>

<p>So they all sat down on a bench to wait, and it
was very still, with nothing but the twittering of the
birds to disturb the morning silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>For a few minutes nobody spoke, and then Maud
inquired wonderingly:</p>

<p>“What makes it so solemn? It feels like church.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s because we’re all feeling rather
solemn ourselves,” Molly answered.</p>

<p>“Hush,” cried Dulcie, suddenly; “I hear a
whistle, and it’s coming from the right direction,
too.”</p>

<p>They all listened, with bated breath, and soon the
whistle sounded again, much nearer this time, and
then came the sound of an approaching train. It
was an accommodation train, too, not one of the expresses,
which frequently rushed by the little station
without stopping, and as it pulled up to the platform,
the four little girls rose from their seats. In
another moment they had all stepped on board.</p>

<p>“We want four tickets for Peak’s Point,” Dulcie
told the conductor, who was regarding them curiously,
and she produced her purse, with the air of an
accustomed traveller. But when she had paid the
fares and the conductor had given her back the
change, her face had lost a little of its cheerful confidence.</p>

<p>“I had no idea it would cost so much,” she told
Daisy, in an anxious whisper. “It was almost two
dollars. That only leaves three to live on till we
find a situation.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>LOOKING FOR A SITUATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was nearly half-past seven when the slow
morning train drew up at the Peak’s Point
Station and four solemn, rather frightened
little passengers stepped out upon the platform.
They were almost the only passengers, and as they
passed out of the car, both conductor and brakeman
looked after them curiously.</p>

<p>“Now I wonder where them young ones can be
off to at this time of the morning,” the brakeman
remarked. “They look as if they were goin’ somewhere
to stay, judgin’ by the parcels they’ve got.”</p>

<p>“They paid their fares all right,” the conductor
answered, “and the biggest one looked pretty well
able to take care of herself. She handed me a five-dollar
bill, and to see her countin’ the change, you’d
think she’d been used to it all her life. Bright as a
button she is, and no mistake.” And then the train
moved on again, and the two men soon forgot the
episode.</p>

<p>In the meantime the four little Winslows had left
the station behind, and were walking up the village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
street, in quest of a bakery, for by this time they
were all decidedly hungry. Dulcie was the only one
of them who had ever been to Peak’s Point before,
but she assured the others that she remembered the
place very well, and knew just where the stores
were.</p>

<p>“We went to a drug-store,” she said, “and Papa
and I had soda-water. It was very good.”</p>

<p>“I hope we can get something besides soda-water
now,” said Molly. “It’s very nice when you’re hot
and thirsty, but I don’t think it would be at all the
thing for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“There’s a baker on the other side of the street,”
cried Maud, joyfully. “There’s some lovely cake
in the window. I’m going to have some.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Maudie, not cake for breakfast,” remonstrated
Daisy. “I never heard of such a thing.”</p>

<p>But Maud was firm.</p>

<p>“I always thought I should like cake for breakfast,”
she maintained. “It would be so different,
you know.”</p>

<p>Daisy looked grave, but Molly was rather inclined
to agree with her younger sister.</p>

<p>“People do have queer things for breakfast sometimes,”
she reminded them. “Don’t you remember
Papa told us about that place in Maine where he
went fishing, and how they gave him pie and doughnuts
every morning at seven o’clock? He said they
were rather good when you were hungry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>So Daisy’s scruples were silenced, and Dulcie volunteered
to make the necessary purchases.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we’d better all go,” she advised.
“People stare so, and I suppose we do look a little
queer, with all our parcels. I’ll leave the bag here
on the sidewalk, and you can watch it till I come
back.”</p>

<p>Nobody had any objections to offer, so Dulcie departed
on her errand, returning in the course of a
few minutes with two well-laden paper bags.</p>

<p>“I bought some rolls,” she announced; “they’re
right out of the oven, the woman said, and I’ve got
some nice fruit cake for Maud. I’m sorry I couldn’t
get any butter, but the rolls are so fresh, I don’t believe
we’ll mind eating them dry.”</p>

<p>But though her voice was cheerful, Dulcie’s face
was grave and troubled, and when they had found a
seat on the steps of a church, and the two younger
children had begun on their impromptu breakfast,
she drew Daisy aside to whisper anxiously:</p>

<p>“Things do cost a great deal more than I supposed
they did. We shan’t be able to live long on
that five dollars of Uncle Stephen’s.”</p>

<p>“How long do you suppose it will take us to find
a situation?” inquired Daisy, with an anxious
glance at her two little sisters.</p>

<p>“Oh, not very long, I don’t believe. Of course,
we must find something before to-night. But I’ve
been thinking that perhaps it would be better not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
eat all these rolls right away. We might get hungry
again by and by, you know, and it isn’t certain that
we shall find a situation before lunch time.”</p>

<p>Daisy—most unselfish of sisters—agreed, although
it cost her something of an effort to put her
second roll back into the paper bag, for, after all,
dry bread is not a very substantial breakfast.
Somehow, nobody felt very well satisfied, and even
Maud admitted that cake really did taste rather
queer so early in the morning, and she would like
a glass of milk.</p>

<p>“I thought I hated milk when Grandma made me
drink it,” she admitted, “but things taste so funny
when you have to eat them dry. Let’s buy some
milk, Dulcie?”</p>

<p>But Dulcie, mindful of the state of their finances,
shook her head.</p>

<p>“Perhaps somebody will give us a drink of
water,” she said, “but I don’t think we’d better buy
anything more now. Wouldn’t you like to live on a
farm, Maud? You might learn to milk the cows
yourself.”</p>

<p>But this suggestion was not at all to Maud’s taste.
“I don’t like cows,” she protested, indignantly;
“I’m afraid of them. Lizzie said a cow chased her
once, when she was a little girl, because she had on
a red dress. She always told us not to go near
them. Oh, I don’t want to go to a place where
there are cows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>Maud—who was beginning to feel both tired and
cross—suddenly burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, Maudie, don’t be silly,” remonstrated
Dulcie. “Maybe we won’t go to a farm at all. I
only thought perhaps farmers might be more likely
to take little girls to work for them than rich people
would. You see, rich people generally have other
servants, and——”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to be a servant,” wailed Maud.
“Servants have to eat in the kitchen, and sometimes
they don’t have any dessert. I want to go
home, even if we are going to have a stepmother. I
don’t believe stepmothers are as bad as having to
be servants, and eat in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Stepmothers are horrid,” declared Molly, with
conviction. “Besides, we don’t want to be burdens
any longer. Do stop crying, Maud, and let’s begin
to look for a situation. I think it’s going to be
rather good fun.”</p>

<p>Thus urged, Maud—who was really a cheerful
little soul—choked back a rising sob and dried her
eyes. Just then the church clock, over their heads,
boomed forth eight strokes, and Dulcie rose.</p>

<p>“Come along,” she said. “I don’t think we’ll
stop at any of these houses. It will be nicer out in
the country.”</p>

<p>The others sighed wearily, but made no objections.
It was the beginning of a very hot day, and
already the sun felt uncomfortably warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>“If we can’t get any milk, I don’t think soda-water
would be so bad, after all,” remarked Molly,
suddenly. “Let’s go back to that drug-store.”
But Daisy—who had decided ideas as to the fitness
of things—would not listen to this suggestion.
Cake for breakfast was bad enough, but soda-water
at eight o’clock in the morning—the thing was unheard
of.</p>

<p>“It would make us all sick,” she assured them,
“and then what could we do? Nobody would take
sick people to work for them.”</p>

<p>That argument proved unanswerable, and Molly
and Maud were forced to submit to remaining
thirsty for the present. A few minutes’ walk
brought them to the end of the village street, and
they turned into a shady, grass-grown road, which
was much pleasanter. Instinctively the children’s
spirits began to rise.</p>

<p>“There’s a lovely house,” exclaimed Molly, coming
to a sudden standstill beside some iron gates.
“Couldn’t we ask there?”</p>

<p>Dulcie hesitated. Truth to tell, now that the
moment had arrived for putting her wonderful
scheme into operation, she was beginning to feel decidedly
nervous and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better go a little farther,” she said.
“It’s pretty early to disturb people; they might not
like it.”</p>

<p>“But ladies are more apt to be at home early in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
the morning,” urged Molly, who was anxious to
have the adventure begin. “Besides, it’s getting
hot, and we’re all thirsty. What are you going to
do about a reference? I’ve heard Grandma say she
would never engage a girl who didn’t have a good
reference.”</p>

<p>Dulcie looked a little startled. She had not
thought of the necessity of references. But just
then Maud put in an anxious question.</p>

<p>“Suppose nobody wants us, and night comes,
where are we going to sleep?”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about night when it’s only just about
breakfast time,” reproved Molly. “We’ll be sure
to find a place long before dinner-time, and I don’t
believe, when the people know who we are, they’ll
make us eat in the kitchen. I think we shall be kind
of lady helps, like Phœbe in ‘Eight Cousins.’
Phœbe did the cooking, but she had lovely times,
too, don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“But Dulcie says we mustn’t let people know our
real names,” Maud reminded her, “so I don’t see
how they can find out who we are.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s going to be fun, anyhow,” maintained
Molly, cheerfully. “I wouldn’t go home again for
anything, after coming so far, and spending all that
money, would you, Dulcie?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Dulcie, “and I suppose,
after all, we might as well begin with this house as
any other. But you mustn’t be disappointed if we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
have to try a good many places before we find any
one who wants us. And—and there’s another
thing; I don’t believe we’d better all go in together.
They might get discouraged if they saw there were
so many of us.”</p>

<p>“But they’ll have to know as soon as they engage
us,” objected Daisy.</p>

<p>“Of course they will, but they needn’t find out
the very first minute. I think the best way will be
for you and me to go first, and then, if the people
seem kind, and want us to stay, we can explain
about the others. Molly and Maud can wait for us
right here, under that big tree. We won’t be gone
long.”</p>

<p>Daisy still looked very doubtful, and Maud began
to object to being left behind, but Dulcie was firm,
and Molly also proved equal to the occasion. So the
question was settled, and the two younger children
comfortably ensconced under a big apple-tree, while
Dulcie and Daisy walked up the wide gravelled path
to the house. It was not a large house, but a very
pretty one. There was a lawn, with flower beds in
front, and the children caught glimpses of a stable
and other outbuildings in the rear. There was
no one to be seen, but as they approached the
house, the sound of a piano could be distinctly
heard.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s practising exercises,” whispered
Dulcie. “Perhaps it’s the lady of the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“There’s a doll’s carriage on the piazza,” said
Daisy, “so there must be a little girl.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” said Dulcie, with a great effort to
speak cheerfully. “If the people have a little girl
of their own, it may make them kinder to other little
girls. I’ve been thinking about our names. I don’t
want to change them any more than I can help; it
doesn’t seem quite honest. I don’t see how I can
very well change Dulcie into anything but Delia, but
you can be Margaret, which is your real name, anyhow,
and Molly can be Mary. I’ll have to decide
about Maud later, but I think our last name had
better be Smith. When people in books change
their names, they nearly always call themselves
Smith or Brown.”</p>

<p>Daisy opened her lips to protest, but at that moment
the sound of the piano ceased, and in another
moment the front door opened, and a very pretty
little girl of eight or nine came out onto the piazza.
She was so pretty that Dulcie and Daisy stopped
short in the path, and stood gazing at her in undisguised
admiration. She had big brown eyes, and
long golden curls, and she was dressed in white, and
wore a string of gold beads round her neck. Altogether,
she looked so much like the picture of a little
princess in one of their fairy books that Dulcie and
Daisy fairly gasped.</p>

<p>As for the stranger herself, she did not seem in
the least surprised, but smiled a bright, welcoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
smile, and came running down the steps to greet the
visitors.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you’ve come,” she cried, joyfully.
“Mamma said she thought you might come
to-day, but I didn’t expect you quite so early. It’s
all right, though; I’ve finished my practicing. I did
a whole half-hour since breakfast. Mamma says
that’s quite enough in summer. Won’t you come
up on the piazza?”</p>

<p>To say that the two little Winslows were surprised
at the cordiality of this greeting would be
but a poor way of expressing their feelings. Indeed,
they were so much astonished as to be, for the
first moment, quite deprived of the power of speech.
Then Dulcie found her voice, and managed to gasp
out:</p>

<p>“You—you were expecting us!”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t exactly expecting you,” the stranger
explained, “because your mother didn’t positively
tell Mamma you would come to-day, but I hoped
you would, because I don’t know any of the children
here yet, and I’m so anxious to have somebody
to play with.”</p>

<p>“I think you must be making a mistake about us,”
said Daisy, who was beginning to grasp the situation.
“Who do you think we are?”</p>

<p>“Why, aren’t you the two little Baxter girls?
Mrs. Baxter came to call on Mamma yesterday, and
she said she would send her two little girls over to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
play with me, so when I saw you, of course I
thought I knew who you were. It doesn’t really
make any difference, though, for I’ve never seen the
Baxters, and I shall probably like you just as much.
You see, Papa has only taken this house for the
summer, and we didn’t come till last Monday, so I
don’t know any of the children who live here.
What are your names, and which house do you
live in?”</p>

<p>Daisy was silent, and Dulcie flushed a little as she
answered.</p>

<p>“Our name is Smith. I’m Delia Smith, and this
is my sister Margaret. We don’t live here, and
we—we didn’t exactly come to see you. We’d like
to speak to your mother.”</p>

<p>The little girl’s face fell.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” she said, “I hoped you had
come to play with me. Mamma has gone to the
station with Papa, but she won’t be gone very long.
I hope you can wait.”</p>

<p>“We can wait,” said Dulcie. She had taken
a fancy to the pretty little girl, and was hoping
that her mother might prove as friendly as herself.</p>

<p>The child looked pleased.</p>

<p>“All right,” she said, hospitably, “and while
you’re waiting, perhaps you’d like to come and see
the rabbits. They’re very cunning, and it’s about
time I gave them their breakfast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>The prospect of feeding rabbits was very alluring,
but Dulcie was mindful of the importance of maintaining
her dignity. People looking for situations
ought not to waste their time on anything so trivial
as rabbits.</p>

<p>“I think perhaps we’d better wait here,” she said.
“Do you happen to know whether your mother
needs any help?”</p>

<p>“Help,” repeated the little girl, rather vaguely,
“what kind of help?”</p>

<p>“Oh, help in the house, or—or in the garden.
Any kind that little girls could do. I thought she
might want some one to wash the dishes, or make
the beds, or——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean a maid,” interrupted her new acquaintance,
with sudden comprehension. “No, I’m
sure Mamma doesn’t need any one. I heard her
tell Papa all the servants were very satisfactory.
What made you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Because we—oh, it doesn’t matter. I’m afraid
there isn’t any use of our waiting to see your mother,
after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t go so soon,” pleaded the little
girl, clasping her hands imploringly. “You’ve only
just come, and I do want somebody to play with so
much. Wait and see Mamma; you’ll love her, and
perhaps she knows some lady who wants a maid. I
suppose your mother wants to find a place for one,
just as Mamma did when we went to Europe last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
year. Don’t you really think you’d like to come
and see the rabbits?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I’m afraid we can’t,” interposed
Daisy, firmly. “We’ve left our—some people
waiting for us on the road, and they might get worried
if we stay away too long.”</p>

<p>“It will only take a few minutes to see the
rabbits,” their new friend urged, “and Mamma will
be back very soon. Do you think those people would
mind waiting just a little longer?”</p>

<p>Dulcie wavered. The little girl was so cordial;
it seemed almost rude to refuse her invitation. She
glanced appealingly at Daisy.</p>

<p>“I think we might stay just a few minutes,”
Daisy agreed. She loved pets, and to possess rabbits
had long been an unfulfilled dream.</p>

<p>So the question was settled, and five minutes later
three very eager little girls were bending lovingly
over a family of soft, wriggling baby rabbits.</p>

<p>“They’re the cunningest things I ever saw,” declared
Daisy, pressing one downy mite to her cheek.
“I do wish Molly and Maud could see them.”</p>

<p>“Who are Molly and Maud?” inquired her new
friend, with interest.</p>

<p>Daisy started and flushed. In the interest of the
moment she had quite forgotten the rôle of Margaret
Smith.</p>

<p>“They are our two sisters,” she explained, with
an apologetic glance at Dulcie. “We all love rabbits,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
but Grandma will never let us have any
pets.”</p>

<p>“You must bring them to see my rabbits,” her
hostess said politely. “I’ve got so many, I’d like
to give you some, if your grandma would let you
have them.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” said Dulcie, “but I’m
afraid we couldn’t take them. You see, we don’t
expect to live at home any longer.”</p>

<p>The brown eyes opened very wide, and their new
acquaintance inquired in a tone of the utmost astonishment:</p>

<p>“Where are you going to live, then?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know,” said Dulcie; “that’s what we
wanted to speak to your mother about. We are
looking for a situation.”</p>

<p>Their new friend gasped.</p>

<p>“But you’re not grown up; you’re only little
girls,” she faltered. “Little girls only work if their
mothers are very poor. You don’t look a bit like
poor people.”</p>

<p>“We’re not exactly poor,” Dulcie explained, “but
there are—reasons why we don’t want to live at
home any more, so we’ve come away to try to find
a situation. We don’t mind working hard, and
there are really a good many things we can do.
We’ve made our own beds and dusted our rooms
ever since Liz—I mean for quite a long time, and
we can wash dishes, and cook a little, too. If we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
could have a cook-book, I think we would manage
very well.”</p>

<p>The look in the little stranger’s eyes had changed
from astonishment to admiration.</p>

<p>“I think you are very clever,” she said. “I wish
I could do useful things like that, but I shouldn’t
like to leave my home. I think I should die if I
had to go away from Mamma and Papa.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you will never have to do it,” Dulcie
reassured her. “You see, it’s quite different with
us. Our mamma is dead, and our papa—oh, well,
we’d rather not talk about it, but it’s all very sad,
and we don’t want to be burdens any longer. Let’s
talk some more about the rabbits.”</p>

<p>Their new friend nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p>“I know how you feel,” she said. “I hate talking
about sad things, too. I don’t like sad stories,
either. Once Mamma read me about little Paul
Dombey, and I cried so much I had a headache.”</p>

<p>“I wish we had a mamma,” said Daisy, with a
sigh. “Children are never burdens to their mothers.
I think yours must be nice; you talk so much about
her.”</p>

<p>“She’s the loveliest lady in the world. She’s so
good that everybody loves her. Haven’t you ever
heard about her?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think we have,” Daisy admitted reluctantly.
“You see, we don’t know very many
people. What’s your mamma’s name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>“Mrs. Richard B. Thorne, and I am Barbara
Muriel Thorne.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a beautiful name!” cried Dulcie.
“I’ve read about Barbaras, but I never met one before.
I wish my name was Barbara, or else Gladys.
Muriel is quite a book name, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are pretty names,” Barbara Muriel
answered, with some pride. “But Delia is rather
a nice name, too,” she added, politely.</p>

<p>“I think it’s about the ugliest name I ever heard,”
said Dulcie. “I can’t think what made me choose
it.”</p>

<p>Barbara looked rather puzzled.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know people ever chose their own
names,” she said. “Are you Baptists?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Dulcie, blushing; “we are Episcopalians.
What made you think we were Baptists?”</p>

<p>“Because Hannah said Baptists weren’t baptized
till they were grown up, and I thought perhaps they
chose their own names, instead of having them given
to them, when they were babies.”</p>

<p>Dulcie was beginning to feel rather uncomfortable,
but fortunately, at that moment, Daisy came to
her rescue.</p>

<p>“Hark!” she exclaimed, eagerly; “I think I hear
a carriage. Perhaps it’s Barbara’s mother.”</p>

<p>Barbara ran to look, and returned in a moment
with the joyful intelligence that it was Mamma
coming home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“She’s just driving round to the front door,” she
said. “I’ll run ahead, and tell her about you.”
And away she flew, followed more slowly by her
two companions.</p>

<p>“I—I feel just like running away,” faltered
Daisy. “Oh, Dulcie, let’s go. It all seems so
very—queer.”</p>

<p>“We can’t run away now,” said Dulcie, and her
tone was decided, though her teeth were beginning
to chatter. “It wouldn’t be polite, and besides, I
think perhaps Barbara’s mother may understand,
and be kind to us.”</p>

<small>STEPMOTHERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the children approached the house they
saw that a pony phaeton was standing by
the front steps, out of which a lady had
just alighted. She was speaking to the groom, who
had run up from the stable to take the horse, but at
the sound of Barbara’s voice she turned to greet her
little daughter, and even at that first glimpse Dulcie
and Daisy could see that she had a very sweet face.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” cried Barbara, reaching her mother’s
side in a rather breathless condition, “here are two
little girls who want to see you. Their names are
Delia and Margaret Smith. The biggest one is
Delia; she chose her name herself, and the littlest
one is Margaret.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thorne greeted the visitors very kindly.</p>

<p>“I am glad Barbara has found some little
friends,” she said. “Suppose we all come into the
house. It is rather warm, and I would like to take
off my hat before doing anything else.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_258_facing">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“<span class="smcap">We’re—we’re looking for a situation.</span>”—<i>Page <a href="#Page_259">259</a>.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Her voice was so kind and cordial, and her smile
so pleasant, that Dulcie and Daisy were both conscious
of a sensation of decided relief. Still, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
situation remained an embarrassing one, for it was
quite evident that Mrs. Thorne supposed them to be
some little neighbors come to make a morning call.
However, there was nothing to be done but to follow
Barbara and her mother into the house, and then
they found themselves in a cool, flower-scented
room, and Mrs. Thorne was saying in her bright,
friendly voice:</p>

<p>“I am sorry you had such a hot morning for your
walk. I hope you did not have far to come.”</p>

<p>“We—we don’t live here,” stammered Dulcie, her
cheeks growing suddenly very hot. “We came in
the train, and walked up from the station.”</p>

<p>“You came on the train?” Mrs. Thorne repeated,
incredulously. “You don’t mean by yourselves?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Dulcie. “You see, we had to.
We’re—we’re looking for a situation.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thorne gazed in growing bewilderment
from one serious little face to the other.</p>

<p>“A situation,” she gasped. “Why, you are only
children.”</p>

<p>“I’m twelve,” said Dulcie, rather tremulously,
“and Dais—I mean Margaret, is eleven. Of course
we wouldn’t expect to be paid very much at first.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand. Why do you want to
work at all? You are not poor children.”</p>

<p>That was just what Barbara had said, and Dulcie
felt her heart sink. How could they ever explain
the situation without telling the whole story?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“We’ve gone away, because we don’t want to be
burdens to our stepmother,” put in Daisy, coming to
her sister’s relief.</p>

<p>A shadow crossed Mrs. Thorne’s sweet face, and
as if instinctively, she slipped an arm round Barbara,
who was standing by her side.</p>

<p>“Don’t you love your stepmother?” she asked,
gently. “Isn’t she kind to you?”</p>

<p>“We’ve never seen her,” Daisy explained.
“She’s only coming to-day. Papa married her in
California, and we never knew anything about it
till yesterday. We are sure she won’t want us, and
we are very tired of being burdens to people, so we
came away to earn our own livings.”</p>

<p>Daisy paused abruptly, and two big tears rolled
slowly down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thorne was really wonderful. She seemed
to understand the whole situation at once, without
asking another question.</p>

<p>“You poor little chicks,” she said, and her voice
was so kind that, instead of checking Daisy’s tears,
it caused her to cry all the more. And then somehow,
they were all on the sofa together, and Mrs.
Thorne had one arm round Daisy, and the other
round Dulcie—who had also begun to cry—and
Barbara was looking on, with tears of sympathy in
her own eyes.</p>

<p>“We love our papa very much indeed,” sobbed
Dulcie, “but we think perhaps he will be glad to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
have us go away, on account of the stepmother, you
know. I promised Mamma before she died that I
would always take care of the others, and stepmothers
are so very cruel sometimes.”</p>

<p>“There, there, dear,” soothed Mrs. Thorne,
“don’t try to talk any more till you feel better. I
think I understand everything. You have made a
foolish mistake, but it’s going to be all right.”</p>

<p>There was something wonderfully reassuring in
that kind, cheerful voice, and in a few minutes the
two little girls had dried their tears, and were beginning
to feel almost cheerful themselves. But
now a new difficulty arose; something that neither
of them had ever thought of. In their absorption
they had quite failed to notice that the hot sunshine
had been suddenly obscured by a dark cloud, until
suddenly the rumble of distant thunder fell upon
their ears. Daisy was on her feet in a moment.</p>

<p>“There’s going to be a thunder-storm!” she exclaimed.
“We must go right after Molly and
Maud. Maud hates thunder.”</p>

<p>“Who are Molly and Maud?” inquired Mrs.
Thorne, and, as if in answer to her question, there
was a sound of little feet on the piazza, and through
the open window came an anxious voice.</p>

<p>“Dulcie, Daisy, where are you? There’s a horrid
thunder-storm coming up.”</p>

<p>“They are our two little sisters,” explained
Dulcie. “We left them out on the road. We were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
afraid people wouldn’t take us if they saw how
many there were. Would you mind very much if
they came in, just till the shower is over? Maud is
so afraid of thunder-storms.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said Mrs. Thorne, who was beginning
to look very much amused. “Run and
bring the little girls in, Barbara.”</p>

<p>Away flew hospitable Barbara, closely followed
by Dulcie and Daisy, and in another moment they
were back again, accompanied by Molly and Maud,
who both looked very red and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“It was all Maud’s fault,” Molly was whispering
apologetically to Dulcie. “I wanted to wait, but the
minute she heard the thunder she was frightened,
and she cried so hard I had to let her come to find
you.”</p>

<p>“It was beginning to thunder,” Maud was at the
same moment explaining to the sympathetic Barbara.
“Dulcie and Daisy stayed away so long, and
I was so thirsty. I thought I was going to like
cake for breakfast, but I didn’t; it left such a funny
taste afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Dulcie and Daisy,” repeated Barbara; “why, I
thought their names were Delia and Margaret.”</p>

<p>Maud looked blank, and Dulcie, blushing furiously,
but still with a desperate attempt to keep up
their assumed characters, hastened to explain.</p>

<p>“Dulcie and Daisy are our home names,” she
said. “Daisy’s real name is Margaret.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“And your real name is Delia, I suppose,” said
Mrs. Thorne, smiling; “Delia Smith, I think you
said.”</p>

<p>Dulcie was silent. She was a truthful child, and
not even for the honor of the Winslow family could
she bring herself to tell a deliberate lie. Mrs.
Thorne seemed to understand, for she smiled again,
and her voice was very kind.</p>

<p>“Barbara darling,” she said, “suppose you take
Molly and Maud into the dining-room, and get them
each a glass of milk. Maud says she is thirsty, and
cake is hardly a substantial breakfast. Ask Jane to
boil some eggs, and warm some oatmeal, and we
will all come in a few minutes. Now, my dear little
girls,” she added in a graver tone, when the three
younger children had left the room, “I want you to
tell me your real names, and where you live. I
must let your family know where you are as soon
as possible. They are probably frightened to death
about you already.”</p>

<p>Dulcie clasped her hands in despair, as she saw
the last hope of carrying out her wonderful plan of
independence fading from her grasp. But there
was an air of gentle determination about Mrs.
Thorne that convinced her of the uselessness of a
refusal. She answered meekly:</p>

<p>“My name is Dulcie Winslow and my sister is
really Margaret, but every one calls her Daisy. We
live at Tarrytown with our grandmother, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“You don’t mean to tell me you are old Dr. Winslow’s
grandchildren!” interrupted Mrs. Thorne, in
a tone of genuine astonishment.</p>

<p>Dulcie nodded, and Daisy asked timidly:</p>

<p>“Did you know our grandfather?”</p>

<p>“I used to see him often when I was a little girl.
We were neighbors in New York, and his son Jim
was a great friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s our papa!” cried Dulcie, shame
and disappointment alike forgotten in the excitement
of this discovery. “How wonderful to
think you knew Papa. Perhaps you knew Mamma,
too.”</p>

<p>“No, I never saw your father after he went to
college, but we were great friends as children. He
was a very nice boy.”</p>

<p>“He’s the loveliest man in the world,” declared
Daisy, with shining eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thorne smiled.</p>

<p>“Is he indeed?” she said. “One would hardly
think you were so fond of him when you have been
trying to run away from him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we weren’t running away from Papa,”
cried Dulcie, quite horrified at the suggestion. “We
love him better than any one else in the world, and
we were so happy when we knew he was coming
home from China, but then we heard about the stepmother,
and I thought—I was afraid——” Dulcie
paused in hopeless confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“We didn’t want to be incumbrances,” said Daisy.
“Aunt Julia Chester said we were incumbrances to
Grandma. Dulcie looked up the word in the dictionary,
and it means the same thing as being a
burden. Dulcie thought we might be able to work
for our living, even if we were only little girls, and
so——”</p>

<p>“And so you ran away, like two very foolish children,
and took your younger sisters with you. I
suppose it never occurred to you how unhappy you
would make your father.”</p>

<p>At this awful suggestion both little girls began to
cry.</p>

<p>“I—I thought he would be proud of us,” sobbed
Dulcie. “I wouldn’t make Papa unhappy for the
whole world.”</p>

<p>“There, there, dear, don’t cry; I knew you
wouldn’t.” And Mrs. Thorne put a kind arm round
the trembling child. “You thought you were doing
something very fine, and now you are going to do
something much finer, by going home again, and
showing your papa that you trust him, and feel sure
he would not do anything to make you unhappy.
As for the stepmother; all stepmothers are not
wicked. There are many who love their stepchildren
dearly. Perhaps your stepmother is longing
to know you, and to make you love her. I
doubt very much that she has ever thought of you
as incumbrances. Now I think breakfast must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
ready, so dry your eyes, and we will join the others
in the dining-room.”</p>

<p>That was a wonderful morning; the children
never forgot it. To Molly and Maud it was a
morning of pure delight, and even their elder sisters,
in spite of several causes for anxiety, could
not help enjoying themselves, whenever they forgot
to think about the future. Mrs. Thorne was very
kind to them all, and Barbara proved a delightful
little hostess. The shower was a very slight one,
and by the time they had finished breakfast, the sun
was shining once more. Mrs. Thorne went out in
the pony phaeton again, and Dulcie and Daisy had
an uncomfortable conviction that her errand was in
some way connected with their affairs. Nothing,
however, was said about their going home at once,
and Barbara took them all out to inspect the rabbits.
When it grew too hot in the sun, they came indoors
again, and Barbara took them up to her nursery—a
room so full of beautiful toys that Molly and Maud
felt as if suddenly transported to fairyland.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose is going to happen?”
Daisy whispered to Dulcie, on the way up-stairs.
“Are we to stay here till somebody comes to take
us home?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Dulcie answered mournfully;
“Mrs. Thorne is attending to everything, and I
don’t like to ask her any questions. The thing I’m
most afraid of is that Grandma may come for us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
herself. It would be dreadful to have to go all the
way home in the train with Grandma.”</p>

<p>At one o’clock Mrs. Thorne called them all down
to luncheon, and it was just as they were finishing
that meal that the telegram arrived. The waitress
brought it in on a tray, and handed it to Mrs.
Thorne, who opened it, and read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Please send children home by next train. They
will be met at the station.”</p>
</div>

<p>There was a moment of dead silence, and then
Mrs. Thorne said quietly:</p>

<p>“The telegram is from your grandmother, in answer
to one I sent her this morning.”</p>

<p>“We thought it was,” said Dulcie, meekly.
“How soon does the next train go?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thorne left the room to consult a time-table,
and Barbara began to express her entire disapproval
of the whole affair.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you can’t stay,” she protested;
“there’s plenty of room. It would be so nice to
have you stay all summer, and we could have such
fun all together. Wouldn’t you like to stay?”</p>

<p>“It would be lovely,” said Dulcie, politely, “but
your mother doesn’t think it would be right. She is
afraid Papa wouldn’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Our papa is coming home to-day,” chimed in
Molly, “and we haven’t seen him for more than a
year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“Papas are pretty nice,” Barbara admitted, “but
of course they’re not like mammas. I don’t think
I could possibly leave Mamma, even to go to the
nicest place in the world. Mamma says perhaps
you can come to see us again some day. I’m so
glad your name isn’t Delia Smith, Dulcie; Dulcie
Winslow is ever so much prettier, and I think I like
Daisy better than Margaret, too. I suppose your
papa would be disappointed if you were away when
he came. Haven’t you any mamma?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dulcie, with a sigh; “she died when
we were very little. I am the only one who can
remember her.”</p>

<p>Barbara looked interested.</p>

<p>“My first mamma died when I was a little baby,”
she said; “I can’t remember her a bit.”</p>

<p>The four little Winslows nearly dropped their
spoons into the ice-cream, so great was their astonishment
at this amazing announcement.</p>

<p>“Your—your what?” gasped Dulcie.</p>

<p>“My first mamma,” repeated Barbara, calmly.
“I’ve got her picture on my bureau, and I always
kiss her good-night. Mamma says she loved me
very much, but I’m sure she loves me just as much
herself, because she says I’m the preciousest thing
in the world.”</p>

<p>At that moment Mrs. Thorne returned, with a
time-table in her hand.</p>

<p>“The next down train leaves here in half an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
hour,” she said; “I’m afraid we shall have to hurry
a little. I have sent word to James to harness the
ponies, and will drive you to the station myself.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Thorne,” said Dulcie, regarding her
hostess with big, astonished eyes, “I hope it isn’t
a rude question, but I’ve got to ask. Are you—are
you Barbara’s stepmother?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thorne laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“So you have found out,” she said. “Yes, I am,
but that doesn’t make any difference in our love for
each other, does it, Barbara darling?” And she
stooped to kiss the little girl, who responded by
flinging both arms round her neck.</p>

<p>“No, indeed it doesn’t,” she cried, heartily. “I
wouldn’t change you for all the mammas in the
world.”</p>

<p>“And we thought all stepmothers were wicked
and cruel,” said Dulcie, slowly. “O dear! I’m
afraid we’ve been dreadfully silly, and I guess we’d
better go home just as soon as we possibly can.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>A HOME-COMING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“YOU are really, without exception, the worst-behaved
children I have ever heard of in
my life. I cannot think of any punishment
severe enough for what you deserve.”</p>

<p>Grandma spoke in a tone of awful sternness, and
her expression was, if possible, even sterner than
her voice. The four little culprits stood before her
in a row, and trembled, but nobody could think of
anything to say. It was half-past three, and the
children had reached home five minutes earlier, and
been sent straight up to Grandma’s room by Mary,
in obedience to the orders she had received. It was
Mary who had met the party at the station, and on
the way home had told them of the excitement and
consternation their disappearance had caused.</p>

<p>“I never saw the old lady so upset before,” she
declared. “She most took Bridget’s and my head
off, and goodness knows we hadn’t anything to do
with it. She read that letter you left on the bureau,
and she thought we’d told you the news about the
stepmother, that was to be kept a secret till your pa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
came home. She telegraphed to Miss Kate to come
home, and she was ’most wild with fright about you,
till that lady’s message came.”</p>

<p>It was all very dreadful, and yet there was a certain
thrill in the knowledge that Grandma had really
been worried about them.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think she’d care much what became of
us,” Dulcie had whispered to Daisy, and Daisy had
answered, with her usual cheerfulness:</p>

<p>“It’s rather nice to know she does care just a
little bit, after all.”</p>

<p>And now they were facing Grandma’s wrath, and
awaiting the punishment which they felt sure was to
follow.</p>

<p>“I cannot conceive how such an absurd idea ever
entered any of your heads,” Mrs. Winslow went on,
eyeing them over her spectacles. “For children in
your position even to contemplate such a plan is
outrageous. A Winslow taking a situation like an
Irish servant girl. It is horrible!” And the aristocratic
old lady actually shuddered.</p>

<p>Dulcie hung her head; her cheeks were crimson.</p>

<p>“It was all my fault,” she said, humbly; “I
thought of it first, and the others didn’t want to do
it at all.”</p>

<p>“I was quite sure you were the ringleader,” returned
Grandma, coldly. “You generally are,
where any mischief is concerned. But Daisy and
Molly are both old enough to know better. Maud is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
still too young to be expected to have judgment of
any kind.”</p>

<p>It was then that Maud did what Dulcie afterwards
described as “a noble thing.” She had been
trying to hide behind Daisy, but at Grandma’s last
words she suddenly stepped forward and spoke.</p>

<p>“If the others are going to be punished,” she said,
in a clear, decided little voice, “I guess you’d better
punish me, too. I knew it was naughty to eat cake
for breakfast, and I did it even when Daisy told me
not to.”</p>

<p>There was a little gasp of admiration from the
three older children, and even Grandma’s stern face
relaxed into something like a grim smile.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see that you are capable of realizing
how naughty you have been,” she said. “I
have had a terrible morning, but thank Heaven, my
responsibility is nearly at an end. Your father arrives
this afternoon, and it will be his duty to decide
upon what punishment you are to receive.”</p>

<p>“Grandma,” cried Dulcie, scarcely able to believe
her ears, “aren’t you going to punish us,
then?”</p>

<p>“Under ordinary circumstances I should certainly
punish you all severely,” Mrs. Winslow answered,
“but with your father’s return my guardianship
over you ceases. I wish I could give him a better
account of your behavior during his absence, but
perhaps I am getting too old to deal with children.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
Let us hope that your stepmother may have better
success than I have had.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, Grandma,” murmured conscientious
Daisy, the tears of mortification starting to her
eyes. “We really did want to be good, and we
hated being burdens.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t say any more about it,” interrupted
Grandma, rather hurriedly. “I dare say
you have been no worse than the majority of children,
except for your absurd behavior of this morning,
which is really beyond the comprehension of
any sane person. Now go to your room and change
your dresses. You none of you look fit to be seen,
and I wish you to be on the piazza to greet your
father and his wife. I have received another telegram
saying they will arrive by the five-ten.”</p>

<p>None of the four had dreamed of getting off so
easily, and yet as they climbed the stairs to their own
room, they were all very silent.</p>

<p>“It’s rather nice to get back, isn’t it?” remarked
Molly, a little unsteadily, glancing about the familiar
bedroom, as Dulcie set down the valise and began
removing the various articles she had packed so
proudly only that morning.</p>

<p>“It seems as if we’d been away for a long time,”
said Maud. “I didn’t know one day could be so
long. Perhaps it’s because we got up so early. I
think I’m getting a little sleepy.”</p>

<p>“Lie down and rest,” Daisy suggested. “It isn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
time to dress yet, and perhaps you can get a little
nap.”</p>

<p>Maud promptly curled herself up on the bed she
and Molly shared, and in five minutes had fallen
fast asleep. But none of the others felt at all inclined
to follow her example. They were all far too much
excited to sleep. They sat close together, and
talked in low, subdued voices, so as not to disturb
Maud.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing we can be thankful for,” said
Daisy. “We’ve found out that stepmothers aren’t
all bad, and that’s a great relief. I don’t believe
Mrs. Thorne ever thought Barbara a burden.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe she did,” Dulcie agreed, “but
then Barbara was only three when Mrs. Thorne
married her father, and you can’t help loving a
cunning little girl of three, but it will be quite different
with us. Grandma will be sure to tell her
how horrid we are, and then she’ll begin to hate us.”</p>

<p>“She won’t hate us if she’s anything like Mrs.
Thorne,” said Daisy, with conviction. “Anyhow,
Papa loves us, and he won’t say we’re horrid. Why
shouldn’t she believe him just as well as Grandma?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’ll think we’ve grown worse since he
went away,” said Dulcie, mournfully, but Daisy refused
to listen to any such gloomy possibilities.</p>

</figure>

<p>“Mrs. Thorne said she was sure Papa wouldn’t
marry anybody who wasn’t going to love us,” she
maintained, “and I’m not going to worry any more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
than I can help. Now let’s think about dressing up.
I’m going to curl Maud’s hair the way Lizzie used
to do it, and Molly must wear her white muslin with
pink ribbons.”</p>

<p>As the clock on the stairs struck five, the four
little girls, all dressed in their best, stepped out on
the piazza, and seated themselves in a solemn row
to await the arrival of the station hack. They were
all feeling very nervous, even Daisy, and nobody felt
much like talking. Grandma was still in her room,
and they had the piazza to themselves.</p>

<p>“Shall we have to kiss the stepmother?” Maud
inquired, anxiously.</p>

<p>“It will depend on whether she wants to kiss us
or not,” answered Dulcie. “We shall kiss Papa
first, of course, and then we’ll see what she wants
to do.”</p>

<p>“Do we say ‘How do you do, stepmother?’”
Maud wanted to know.</p>

<p>Dulcie shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that would do,” she said, doubtfully.
“It doesn’t sound exactly polite.”</p>

<p>“Barbara calls Mrs. Thorne ‘Mamma,’” said
Molly. “Do you think she will want us to call her
Mamma?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said Dulcie, reddening. “I don’t
want to call anybody Mamma except our own dear
mamma in Heaven.”</p>

<p>“Barbara talked about her first mamma,” Daisy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
reminded them. “I think we’d better let Papa decide
what we are to call her. He’s sure to know
what is right,” she finished, with the comforting
conviction that Papa always knew best about everything.</p>

<p>Just then the whistle of an approaching train fell
upon their ears, and Grandma, in her best black silk,
came out onto the piazza.</p>

<p>It was only a quarter of a mile to the station, and
in the silence that followed they could hear the
stopping of the train, and then the puffing of the
engine as it moved on again. Grandma sat in a
rocking-chair and folded her hands in her lap. She
didn’t look in the least excited, not even ruffled.
As for the four little girls, their hearts were beating
so fast they could scarcely breathe. Half-unconsciously
Dulcie slipped her hand into Daisy’s, and
held it tight. There followed five minutes of breathless
suspense, and then came the sound of approaching
wheels. In another moment the station hack
had turned in at the gate, and drawn up before the
front steps.</p>

<p>“Papa, dear, dear Papa!” In the first joyful
moment everything else in the world was forgotten,
and four pairs of arms were held out, as four little
figures rushed forward to meet the tall, smiling gentleman,
who had sprung from the carriage, and
was bounding up the steps.</p>

<p>“Well, chicks, here I am!” cried Mr. Winslow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
kissing them all round, “glad to see me, eh? Not
half as glad as I am to see you all, I’ll be bound.
How you have grown, Dulcie. How well you are
looking, Daisy. Can these two big girls really be
my babies, Molly and Maud? And here’s Grandma,
too.” And he released himself from the children’s
clinging arms, and went forward to greet his stepmother.</p>

<p>And now there was another joyful cry, but this
time it was mingled with astonishment.</p>

<p>“Miss Leslie, oh, Miss Leslie, we’re so glad to
see you! We never knew you were coming, too.”
And the pretty young lady, who had followed Mr.
Winslow up the steps, suddenly found herself being
violently hugged by four very excited little
girls.</p>

<p>“Where’s Uncle Stephen?” inquired Daisy, who
was the first to recover from the surprise. “Didn’t
Uncle Stephen come, too?”</p>

<p>Miss Leslie laughed and blushed.</p>

<p>“No, dear,” she said, “he didn’t come this time,
but he sent a great deal of love to you all, and hopes
to see you when he comes East next winter.”</p>

<p>“But—but, isn’t he going to—aren’t you——”
Daisy paused in utter bewilderment. If Miss Leslie
were not going to marry Uncle Stephen, then why
had she come? And, more astonishing still, where,
oh, where was the dreaded stepmother? She
glanced in the direction of the hack, in quest of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
third occupant, but the only other person to be seen
was the driver, who had sprung down from his seat
and was lifting out the bags.</p>

<p>In the meantime Maud was giving Miss Leslie an
important bit of news.</p>

<p>“We’re making you some wedding presents,” she
announced, giving the visitor’s hand an affectionate
squeeze. “I won’t tell you what they are, because
they’re going to be a surprise.”</p>

<p>Mr. Winslow caught the words, and turned
anxiously to his mother.</p>

<p>“What does she mean?” he inquired, sharply.
“They haven’t been told, have they?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say they have,” Mrs. Winslow
answered. “It was not my fault. I have said
nothing, in accordance with your request, and neither
has Kate. All the trouble has come through that
meddlesome gossip, Lizzie. I always told you she
was not the proper person to have the care of children,
but you would never listen.”</p>

<p>Mr. Winslow looked annoyed, but before he could
speak, Molly put into words the question that had
been filling all their minds.</p>

<p>“Where is she?” she demanded, looking in astonishment
from one face to another.</p>

<p>“Where is who, dear?” Miss Leslie asked, gently.</p>

<p>“Why, the stepmother,” said Molly. “Lizzie
said Papa was bringing her home.”</p>

<p>Miss Leslie laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“I am the stepmother,” she said, and stooped to
kiss the astonished Molly as she spoke.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was long past the children’s bedtime, as
Grandma had several times reminded them, but
somehow nobody had seemed to hear, and at last
Grandma had gone indoors, in disgust, leaving the
rest of the Winslow family on the piazza. They
were a very happy party. Dulcie and Daisy each
occupied an arm of their father’s chair, Molly sat
on his knee, and Maud was comfortably ensconced
in the lap of the “stepmother”!</p>

<p>“It’s been the most wonderful day we ever had
in our lives,” said Daisy, with a little sigh of utter
content. “It began pretty badly, but the end was
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“I shall never, never again try to imitate book
people,” declared Dulcie. “Things never happen the
way you expect them to. I ought to have found it
out the day we tried to find ‘the stolen child,’ but I
went right on, and did another silly thing, that was
a great deal worse. Oh, Papa dear, are you quite
sure you don’t think I ought to be punished? It
really was all my fault, you know.”</p>

<p>Mr. Winslow smiled and patted her cheek.</p>

<p>“I think we will let the punishment go this once,”
he said, glancing at his wife. “Don’t you agree
with me, Florence?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” the stepmother answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
heartily. “All is well that ends well, you know, and
I don’t believe they will try looking for situations
again.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, we won’t,” promised Dulcie. “Oh,
Mamma, if we had only known it was going to be
you, we should have been so happy!”</p>

<p>“You don’t think I am going to be a cruel stepmother,
then?” Mrs. Winslow said, smiling.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you could be cruel, even if you
tried,” Dulcie declared, and Daisy added, softly:</p>

<p>“We loved you the first time we saw you, and
we’ve been loving you ever since. We were so glad
when we thought you were going to marry Uncle
Stephen, but to have you for our own mamma is
the most beautiful thing that could possibly happen.”</p>

<p>There were tears in Mrs. Winslow’s eyes, and she
drew Daisy to her side and kissed her.</p>

<p>“You haven’t loved me one bit more than I have
loved you,” she said, a little unsteadily. “I have
been longing for you all ever since that afternoon
last January, and, oh, I do hope God will help me
to be a real mother to you.”</p>

<p>They were all silent for a moment after that. It
was very beautiful out there in the moonlight, and
nobody felt like speaking. At last Molly broke the
silence.</p>

<p>“Do you really mean it?” she questioned, anxiously.
“You’re not just saying it to be polite,
are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Mean what, dear?” Mrs. Winslow asked.</p>

<p>“That about wanting us ever since last winter?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do mean it,” her stepmother answered,
and there was a ring of sincerity in her voice that
banished the children’s last lingering doubt. “I
have never wanted anything quite so much in my
life. Why, Molly darling, I wanted you even before
I ever saw you.”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” cried Dulcie, with sparkling eyes,
“it’s all right, children. We know Papa wants us,
and if Mamma does, too, why—why, don’t you
see—oh, it’s so beautiful! We won’t be burdens or
incumbrances any more!”</p>

are eagerly sought by children all over
the country. There are three good stories in
this book, instead of one, and it is hard to

hard for her to understand many things that she must learn. But her good
heart carries her through, and her conscientiousness and moral courage
win affection and happiness.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS is considerably longer than the other
books by this favorite writer, and with a
more elaborate plot, but it has the same winsome
quality throughout. It introduces the
heroine in New York as a little girl of eight,
but soon passes over six years and finds her at
a select family boarding school in Connecticut.
An important part of the story also takes place
at the Profile House in the White Mountains.
The charm of school-girl friendship is finely
brought out, and the kindness of heart, good
sense and good taste which find constant expression
in the books by Miss Rhoades do not
lack for characters to show these best of
qualities by their lives. Other less admirable
persons of course appear to furnish the alluring mystery, which is not
all cleared up until the very last.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THESE stories of magic and adventure
come from the countries at
the “top of the world,” and will
transport thither in fancy the children
who read this unusual book. They
tell of Lapps and reindeer (even a
golden-horned reindeer!), of prince
and herd-boy, of knights and wolves
and trolls, of a boy who could be
hungry and merry at the same time—of
all these and more besides! Miss Poulsson’s numerous
and long visits to Norway, her father’s land, and the fact that
she is an experienced writer for children are doubtless the
reasons why her translations are sympathetic and skilful, and
yet entirely adapted to give wholesome pleasure to the young
public that she knows so well.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE varying forms of Christmas observance
at different times and in
different lands are entertainingly shown
by one trained in choosing and presenting
the best to younger readers. The
symbolism, good cheer, and sentiment
of the grandest of holidays are shown
as they appeal in similar fashion to those
whose lives seem so widely diverse. The
first chapter tells of the Yule-Tide of the
Ancients, and the eight succeeding chapters deal respectively
with the observance of Christmas and New Year’s, making
up the time of “Yule,” or the turning of the sun, in England,
Germany, Scandinavia, Russia, France, Italy, Spain, and
America. The space devoted to each country has at least
one good illustration.</p>

interesting reading for all who love to come in loving contact with others
in their high and pure enjoyments.”—<i>Herald-Presbyter, Cincinnati.</i></p>
